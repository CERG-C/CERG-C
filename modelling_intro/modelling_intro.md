# Modelling Volcanic Processes

The **Physical volcanology and volcanic risk** class aims to provide students with an overview of processes that turn volcanic surface phenomena into potential threats to surrounding communities. Starting from field observations, the class will review how parent magma rises to the surface and identify the processes that control the behaviour of the associated phenomena (i.e., effusive vs explosive, fall vs flow etc.). Once identified, these processes will be investigated using controlled experiments in the lab and numerical modelling, and will be use to explore how and why i) natural phenomena becomes hazards and ii) how hazards become a risk to communities.

The class is split into two modules in the fall and spring semesters.

#### Fall

The fall part of the class consists in **Modelling Volcanic Processes**. Using case studies and practical exercises, we explore how theoretical, numerical and experimental modelling can be used to investigate a variety of eruptive processes. The first module introduces concepts of physical volcanology rooted in field observations and reviews how field-based studies can help characterize and classify eruptions. The second and third modules introduce components of lab experiments and numerical modeling to investigate the shortcomings identified during module 1.

#### Spring

Main concepts of volcanic risk reduction are introduced. Using the knowledge gained during the fall semester, this module provides an introduction to the development of eruption scenarios used in stochastic modelling to produce probabilistic hazard assessments. This hazard assessment is then used in combination with key component of risk (e.g., vulnerability, resilience)  to illustrate an integrated approach to volcanic risk reduction. La Palma (Spain) is used as a case study to discuss various aspects of volcanic hazard, impact and risk assessment.



## Objectives

At the end of this course, students will be able to:

- [x] characterize the dynamics of eruptions
- [x] describe the physics of main volcanic flows
- [x] understand the basics of numerical and experimental modelling of eruptive processes
- [x] define the main steps of hazard assessments
- [x] understand volcanic hazard maps
- [x] combine the volcanic hazard, exposure and vulnerability for the assessment of risk
- [x] identify key risk reduction strategies

## Evaluation mode

The evaluation of the Fall and the Spring sessions will be combined as follows:
