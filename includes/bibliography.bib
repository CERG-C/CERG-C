abstract = {We have recognized a type of pyroclastic deposit formed by the interaction of water and silicic magma during explosive eruptions. These deposits have a widespread dispersal, similar to plinian tephra, but the overall grain size is much tiner. Several deposits studied can be associated with caldera lakes or sea water and water/magma interaction is proposed to account for the fine grain size. Several examples have been studied, including the Oruanui Formation, N.Z., and the Askja 1875 deposit. Both show little downwind decrease in median diameter, a downwind decrease in sorting ($\sigma$$\phi$) (more evident in the Askja deposit) and coarse tail grading. The Askja example has base surge deposits near source and some Oruanui members show multiple thin beds near source; both are common features of phreatomagmatic deposits. Isopachs of the Askja deposit indicate a source under Lake Oskjuvatn in Askja Caldera and those of the Oruanui indicate a source under the NW part of Lake Taupo. In terms of dispersal area, volume and calculated eruption column heights, these deposits are similar to plinian. However, their extreme fragmentation due to magma/water interaction, superimposed on fragmentation imparted by carlier vesiculation, gives a much finer and more complex grain size distribution than plinian counterparts. The field of phreatomagmatic equivalents to plinian pumice deposits was unoccupied on Walker's (1973) classification of explosive volcanic eruptions. Such deposits are the phreatomagmatic analogue of plinian deposits and the name « phreatoplinian » is proposed. {\textcopyright} 1978 Intern.

abstract = {Tephra thickness distribution is the primary piece of information used to reconstruct the histories of past explosive volcanic eruptions. We present a method for modeling tephra thickness with less subjectivity than is the case with hand-drawn isopachs, the current, most frequently used method. The algorithm separates the thickness of a tephra fall deposit into a trend and local variations and models them separately using segmented linear regression and ordinary kriging. The distance to the source vent and downwind distance are used to characterize the trend model. The algorithm is applied to thickness datasets for the Fogo Member A and North Mono Bed 1 tephras. Simulations on subsets of data and cross-validation are implemented to test the effectiveness of the algorithm in the construction of the trend model and the model of local variations. The results indicate that model isopach maps and volume estimations are consistent with previous studies and point to some inconsistencies in hand-drawn maps and their interpretation. The most striking feature noticed in hand-drawn mapping is a lack of adherence to the data in drawing isopachs locally. Since the model assumes a stable wind field, divergences from the predicted decrease in thickness with distance are readily noticed. Hence, wind direction, although weak in the case of Fogo A, was not unidirectional during deposition. A combination of the isopach algorithm with a new, data transformation can be used to estimate the extent of fall deposits. A limitation of the algorithm is that one must estimate “by hand” the wind direction based on the thickness data.},

abstract = {The {\~{}}4-ka trachytic Rungwe Pumice (RP) deposit from Rungwe Volcano in South-Western Tanzania is the first Plinian-style deposit from an African volcano to be closely documented focusing on its physical characterization. The RP is a mostly massive fall deposit with an inversely graded base. Empirical models suggest a maximum eruption column height H T of 30.5–35 km with an associated peak mass discharge rate of 2.8–4.8 × 108 kg/s. Analytical calculations result in H T values of 33 ± 4 km (inversion of TEPHRA2 model on grain size data) corresponding to mass discharge ranging from 2.3 to 6.0 × 108 kg/s. Lake-core data allow extrapolation of the deposit thinning trend far beyond onland exposures. Empirical fitting of thickness data yields volume estimates between 3.2 and 5.8 km3 (corresponding to an erupted mass of 1.1–2.0 × 1012 kg), whereas analytical derivation yields an erupted mass of 1.1 × 1012 kg (inversion of TEPHRA2 model). Modelling and dispersal maps are consistent with nearly no-wind conditions during the eruption. The plume corner is estimated to have been ca. 11–12 km from the vent. After an opening phase with gradually increasing intensity, a high discharge rate was maintained throughout the eruption, without fountain collapse as is evidenced by a lack of pyroclastic density current deposits.},

abstract = {Regardless of the recent advances in geophysical monitoring and real-time quantitative observations of explosive volcanic eruptions, the characterization of tephra deposits remains one of the largest sources of information on Eruption Source Parameters (ESPs) (i.e. plume height, erupted volume/mass, Mass Eruption Rate — MER, eruption duration, Total Grain-Size Distribution — TGSD). ESPs are crucial for the characterization of volcanic systems and for the compilation of comprehensive hazard scenarios but are naturally associated with various degrees of uncertainties that are traditionally not well quantified. Recent studies have highlighted the uncertainties associated with the estimation of ESPs mostly related to: i) the intrinsic variability of the natural system, ii) the observational error and iii) the strategies used to determine physical parameters. Here we review recent studies focused on the characterization of these uncertainties and we present a sensitivity analysis for the determination of ESPs and a systematic investigation to quantify the propagation of uncertainty applied to two case studies. In particular, we highlight the dependence of ESPs on specific observations used as input parameters (i.e. diameter of the largest clasts, thickness measurements, area of isopach contours, deposit density, downwind and crosswind range of isopleth maps, and empirical constants and wind speed for the determination of MER). The highest uncertainty is associated to the estimation of MER and eruption duration and is related to the determination of crosswind range of isopleth maps and the empirical constants used in the empirical parameterization relating MER and plume height. Given the exponential nature of the relation between MER and plume height, the propagation of uncertainty is not symmetrical, and both an underestimation of the empirical constant and an overestimation of plume height have the highest impact on the final outcome. A ±20{\%} uncertainty on thickness measurements, area of isopach contours, integration limit for the power-law fit and deposit density result in ESP uncertainties ≤±20{\%} for plume height and erupted volume/mass. Finally, a third case study has also been used to explore the sensitivity of the Voronoi Tessellation strategy for the determination of TGSD and the inversion on both mass/area and grain-size data for the determination of erupted mass and plume height. Results confirm the validity of the methods but also the strong dependence on the distribution and number of observations.},

abstract = {A classification scheme is proposed based on measurements made on the resulting pyroclastic fall deposits, the significant parameters being the area of dispersal and degree of fragmentation of the material. An empirical measure of the first is the area enclosed by the 0.01 Tmax isopach (where Tmax is the maximum thickness of the deposit), called D, which ranges from less than 10 km2 for deposits of strongly cone-building type to more than 1000 km2 for deposits of strongly sheet-forming type. An empirical measure of the second is the percentage of material finer than 1 mm in the deposit, or more simply at the point where the 0.1 Tmax isopach crosses the dispersal axis. The latter value, called F, varies from less than 20 for deposits in which fragmentation was mainly achieved by the tearing apart of magma, to more than 80 where it was largely due to thermal shock resulting from the quenching of lava by water.},

@article{LePennec2012,
abstract = {Repeated ash fall events have occurred during the 1999-ongoing eruption of Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador, notably during the late 1999 and August 2001 eruptive phases. While the eruptive styles were similar, these two phases had different impacts on nearby rural and urban Andean populations: ash falls in late 1999 had limited effects on human health and farming, whereas the 2001 phase resulted in medical problems, death of animals in livestock, and damages to houses and crops. Here we investigate the origin of this difference by estimating the size of the August 2001 event (VEI, magnitude, intensity), and by comparing monitoring information of the 1999 and 2001 phases (duration, explosion rate, column height, SO2 output rate). The results show that both phases ranked at VEI 3, although the longer 1999 phase was likely larger than the 2001 phase. Mass magnitude (M) and intensity (I) indexes calculated for the 2001 phase reach M≈2.7 and I≈6.5 when based on ash fall layer data, but increase to M≈3.2 and I≈7.0 when ballistic products are included. We investigated the influence of rain fall and wind flow regimes on ash dispersion, sedimentation and remobilization. The analysis indicates that the harmful effect of the 2001 phase resulted from unfavorable conditions that combined volcanological and seasonal origins, including: a) a low elevation of the ash plume above rural regions owed to a usually bent-over column, b) ash sedimentation in a narrow area west of the volcano under sub-steady wind directions, c) anticipated ash settling by frequent rain flushing of low intensity, and d) formation of a wet cohesive ash coating on buildings and harvests. Conversely, the stronger 1999 phase injected a large amount of ash at higher elevation in the dry season; the ash was widely disseminated across the whole Ecuadorian territory and beyond, and was frequently removed by rain and winds. In summary, our study illustrates the influences of eruption size and weather conditions on the impact of volcanic activity in a tropical setting and puts emphasis on the necessity to merge volcanological and meteorological monitoring duties for hazard assessment and alert level definition, in order to mitigate the effect of ash falls in the Andes and elsewhere.},

AshCalc provides a simple and intuitive tool to speed up the analysis of tephra deposits and compare and contrast the fits for each model. Two improvements in terms of computational performance are implemented in AshCalc for the estimation of the parameters for the Weibull model. The first is an analytic method for reducing the number of free parameters, whilst the second exaggerates the minima in parameter space, leading to a more robust solution. We show that AshCalc provides volume estimates in line with other previously published estimates and hence can be used with a high degree of confidence. We include the open source python code for Ashcalc with the intention that it can be used both as a stand-alone program and integrated into other python projects.},

abstract = {The determination of eruptive parameters is crucial in volcanology, not only to document past eruptions, but also for tephra fallout hazard assessments. In most tephra fallout studies, eruptive parameters have been determined either by empirical techniques or analytical models, but the uncertainty of such parameters is usually not well described. We have applied both empirical and analytical models to characterize the climactic phase of the 2450BP Plinian eruption of Pululagua (BF2 layer) and explore the variations in the total erupted mass, column height and total grain size distribution. Both approaches yield comparable results in the total mass of tephra erupted (4.5±1.5×1011kg), while they show some discrepancies for the determination of the column height (36–20km from empirical techniques and 30–20km from analytical techniques). The total grain size distribution of the BF2 layers varies with the different techniques used for the calculation and significantly affects the outputs of analytical models. Furthermore, the determination of the total grain size distribution depends strongly on the number and spatial distribution of the sample location. Inverting tephra fallout deposits on the total accumulation (or thickness) gives a good constraint on the total mass erupted but not on the column height. However, inverting on individual grain size classes better constrains the possible range of column heights (but cannot resolve particle release height). Results from the inversion on individual grain size classes show that large diffusion coefficients are necessary to model the BF2 layer and might be required to model proximal tephra deposits in order not to overestimate the total erupted mass. Additionally, we used a statistical method (smoothed bootstrap approach) to quantify the uncertainty in eruptive parameters such as column height and total erupted mass. Our uncertainty analysis yields a mean total erupted mass of 4.5±0.3×1011kg and a mean column height of 30±3km. Results from the uncertainty analysis compare well with results from other approaches. Finally, although the climactic phase of the 2450BP Plinian eruption of Pululagua occurred in relatively calm atmospheric conditions, our results show that the dispersion of the BF2 layer was influenced by slight northeasterly wind conditions.},

abstract = {The Total Grain-Size Distribution (TGSD) of tephra deposits is crucial for hazard assessment and provides fundamental insights into eruption dynamics. It controls both the mass distribution within the eruptive plume and the sedimentation processes and can provide essential information on the fragmentation mechanisms. TGSD is typically calculated by integrating deposit grain-size at different locations. The result of such integration is affected not only by the number, but also by the spatial distribution and distance from the vent of the sampling sites. In order to evaluate the reliability of TGSDs, we assessed representative sampling distances for pyroclasts of different sizes through dedicated numerical simulations of tephra dispersal. Results reveal that, depending on wind conditions, a representative grain-size distribution of tephra deposits down to 100 $\mu$m can be obtained by integrating samples collected at distances from less than one tenth up to a few tens of the column height. The statistical properties of TGSDs representative of a range of eruption styles were calculated by fitting the data with a few general distributions given by the sum of two log-normal distributions (bi-Gaussian in $\Phi$-units), the sum of two Weibull distributions, and a generalized log-logistic distribution for the cumulative number distributions. The main parameters of the bi-lognormal fitting correlate with height of the eruptive columns and magma viscosity, allowing general relationships to be used for estimating TGSD generated in a variety of eruptive styles and for different magma compositions. Fitting results of the cumulative number distribution show two different power law trends for coarse and fine fractions of tephra particles, respectively.Our results shed light on the complex processes that control the size of particles being injected into the atmosphere during volcanic explosive eruptions and represent the first attempt to assess TGSD on the basis of pivotal physical quantities, such as magma viscosity and plume height. Our empirical method can be used to assess the main features of TGSD necessary for numerical simulations aimed to real-time forecasting and long-term hazard assessment when more accurate field-derived TGSDs are not available.},

abstract = {The 1991 Hekla eruption started on 17th of January with an intense 50-min-long explosive phase that transitioned into fire fountain activity lasting for 2 days. The eruptive plume rose to maximum height in about 10 min and the total mass of tephra deposited from the opening phase was 8.6 × 109 kg (VEI 3 event). The principal axis of tephra fall is to the NNE of Hekla and grain-size analysis reveals a systematic decrease in grain-size away from source. Majority of sample sites show typically unimodal grain-size distributions, although a few have bimodal distributions where the secondary mode is a subtle finer peak. The calculated total grain-size distribution (TGSD) is bimodal, with a coarse primary peak (−3.5 to −2.5 $\phi$) and a subordinate fine peak (2.5 to 3.5 $\phi$). The coarse peak is lapilli-dominated and was deposited within the first 25 km of transport, whereas the fine peak is coarse-ash-dominated and fits well with the modal grain-size of samples deposited {\textgreater}65 km from Hekla. Ascent rate of the magma and conditions for vesiculation in the shallow conduit became increasingly uniform with time through the 1991 opening phase.},

abstract = {Studies of grain-size distributions of explosive volcanic eruptions provide important insights into fragmentation mechanisms and eruptive conditions and are crucial to the modeling of tephra dispersal. As a result of sedimentation processes and plume dynamics, grain-size features vary significantly both in the downwind and crosswind directions and are difficult to characterize. We have analyzed grain-size features in the downwind and crosswind directions of the two largest eruptions of the last 2000 years of Cotopaxi volcano activity (Ecuador). Crosswind grain-size variations are similar for both eruptions (i.e., layers 3 and 5), while at any given downwind distance from vent, the layer 3 deposit is coarser than the layer 5 one. This suggests that layers 3 and 5 were characterized by similar plume height but that layer 3 was advected by a stronger wind. In addition, both deposits are coarsest along the dispersal axis and become richer in ash in the crosswind direction showing a Gaussian decreasing rate. Deposit thickness also shows a Gaussian crosswind decay, but layer 3 is significantly thicker at all points than is layer 5 due to the former's larger erupted mass. Based on both quantitative analysis of field data and on numerical simulations, we show that tephra deposits associated with large explosive eruptions (i.e., plume height of 30 km) should be sampled out to at least 200 km from the vent (depending on wind speed and tropopause height) in order to derive complete grain-size distributions that are not depleted in fines. Eruptions occurring in a strong wind field at high latitudes (e.g., Iceland) require lesser representative-sampling distances because of the lower tropopause heights.},

abstract = {We synthesize field and experimental data to evaluate relationships between the textures and sizes of pyroclasts and the processes that shape them, with emphasis on the role of permeability. In (mafic) scoria, the important competition that determines preserved vesicularity is between gas escape and magma expansion by bubble growth; post-fragmentation expansion occurs rapidly until the permeability increases substantially. In (silicic) pumice, the competition is between gas escape and fragmentation by bubble overpressure; sufficiently permeable regions allow gas escape although high viscosity hinders further expansion. Thus the preserved vesicularity of both pumice and scoria is controlled by the permeability threshold, the vesicularity at which there is an abrupt increase in permeability over a small increase in vesicularity, which appears to be {\&}{\#}8764;70{\&}{\#}8211;80{\%}. High permeability thresholds may also explain the high fine ash content of silicic Plinian eruptions. At the local scale, magma ruptures because of stresses in viscous melt around expanding isolated bubbles. Local control is illustrated by the correspondence between the size distributions of the ash and of bubbles in individual pumice clasts of the 1980 Mount St. Helens Plinian eruption: the medians and modes for grain and bubble sizes are of order tens of microns, and fractal dimensions are similar (3.1{\&}{\#}8211;3.2 for grains; 3.4 for bubbles). Fractal dimensions for total grain size distributions and bubble size distributions in pumice from other silicic eruptions are similar (3.0{\&}{\#}8211;3.2, 2.9{\&}{\#}8211;3.9, respectively) and larger than generated by crushing and grinding rocks. This suggests that fragmentation efficiency depends on the balance between rates of magma decompression (overpressurization) and gas escape, which explains relationships between ash content and eruption rate. In summary, the vesicularity distribution of pyroclasts places important constraints on the permeability threshold of expanding magma, whereas the whole deposit grain size distribution of pyroclastic deposits places critical limits on the permeability structure of the magma at the point of fragmentation.},

abstract = {Tephra fallout represented a major source of hazard for eastern Sicily during the 2001 eruption of Mt. Etna (Italy) between 19 July and 6 August. Long-lasting explosive activity was generated from the 2570 m vent, producing a volcanic plume up to 5 km high above sea level. The eruption caused copious lapilli and ash fallout over the volcano flanks for several days. Flight operations were cancelled at the Catania and Reggio Calabria airports; health risk and economic damage put communities living close to this active volcano on the alert. The explosive activity at the 2570 m vent had three main phases characterized by phreatomagmatic, magmatic and vulcanian explosions. In this paper, we analyze the first explosive phase between 19 and 24 July that formed a tephra deposit on the volcano's south-east flanks. Immediately after the first phase of the eruption, numerous tephra samples were collected in order to draw an isomass map, calculate physical parameters for the eruption and analyze the plume dispersion on the basis of deposit geometry. The tephra deposit shows a bilobate shape due to the change with time of both the vigour of the eruption and the wind direction and velocity that caused a higher rate of particle accumulation along two dispersal axes (SE and SSE). The total mass of tephra erupted was calculated with two different fitting methods: exponential line segments and a power law fit on the semi-logarithmic plot of mass per unit area versus area, resulting in values of 1.02⁎109 kg and 2.31⁎109 kg, respectively. The whole deposit grain-size was calculated applying the Voronoi tessellation method, it shows a mode of 2ϕ and thus indicates a high degree of magma fragmentation during the first phase of the eruption. Plume dispersal was investigated by an advection–diffusion model to reconstruct the tephra deposit. In the modelling, we took into account the variations of wind direction and velocity, and eruption intensity by dividing the explosive phase into sixteen sub-eruptions and considering the final deposit as the sum of the mass computed for each sub-eruption. Using best fit procedures, we find that the optimal agreement between computed values and field data is obtained by using the total mass calculated with the power law fit and a terminal settling velocity distribution with a particle aggregation model. The computed tephra dispersal was able to reproduce the bilobate shape of the real deposit. This work proves that advection–diffusion models can describe sedimentation processes of weak, i.e., bent-over, long-lasting plumes if the variations of wind direction and velocity, and eruptive intensity are included.},

abstract = {Classifications of volcanic eruptions were first introduced in the early twentieth century mostly based on qualitative observations of eruptive activity, and over time, they have gradually been developed to incorporate more quantitative descriptions of the eruptive products from both deposits and observations of active volcanoes. Progress in physical volcanology, and increased capability in monitoring, measuring and modelling of explosive eruptions, has highlighted shortcomings in the way we classify eruptions and triggered a debate around the need for eruption classification and the advantages and disadvantages of existing classification schemes. Here, we (i) review and assess existing classification schemes, focussing on subaerial eruptions; (ii) summarize the fundamental processes that drive and parameters that characterize explosive volcanism; (iii) identify and prioritize the main research that will improve the understanding, characterization and classification of volcanic eruptions and (iv) provide a roadmap for producing a rational and comprehensive classification scheme. In particular, classification schemes need to be objective-driven and simple enough to permit scientific exchange and promote transfer of knowledge beyond the scientific community. Schemes should be comprehensive and encompass a variety of products, eruptive styles and processes, including for example, lava flows, pyroclastic density currents, gas emissions and cinder cone or caldera formation. Open questions, processes and parameters that need to be addressed and better characterized in order to develop more comprehensive classification schemes and to advance our understanding of volcanic eruptions include conduit processes and dynamics, abrupt transitions in eruption regime, unsteadiness, eruption energy and energy balance.},

Eruptive activity during 4{\&}{\#}8211;8 May 2010 was characterized based on short-duration physical parameters in order to capture transient eruptive behavior of a long-lasting eruption (i.e., total grain-size distribution, erupted mass, and mass eruption rate averaged over 30 min activity). The resulting 30 min total grain-size distribution based on both ground and Meteosat Second Generation-Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (MSG-SEVIRI) satellite measurements is characterized by Mdphi of about 2 {\$}\backslashphi{\$} and a fine-ash content of about 30 wt {\%}. The accumulation rate varied by 2 orders of magnitude with an exponential decay away from the vent, whereas Mdphi shows a linear increase until about 18 km from the vent, reaching a plateau of about 4.5 {\$}\backslashphi{\$} between 20 and 56 km. The associated mass eruption rate is between 0.6 and 1.2 � 105 kg s{\&}{\#}8722;1. In situ sampling showed how fine ash mainly fell as aggregates of various typologies. About 5 to 9 wt {\%} of the erupted mass remained in the cloud up to 1000 km from the vent, suggesting that nearly half of the ash {\textgreater}7{\$}\backslashphi{\$} settled as aggregates within the first 60 km. Particle sphericity and shape factor varied between 0.4 and 1 with no clear correlation to the size and distance from vent. Our experiments also demonstrate how satellite retrievals and Doppler radar grain-size detection can provide a real-time description of the source term but for a limited particle-size range.},

abstract = {Tephra deposits retain a considerable amount of information about the nature of volcanic eruptions, with plume height commonly inferred from maximum clast size measurements. However, current methods for inferring plume height from maximum clast size lose some of the accuracy in measurements made in the field and have limited application when trying to constrain the uncertainty in these parameters. Here a predictive numerical model is used to determine plume height from maximum clast size found in a deposit. Plume height is an essential parameter for inferring eruption magnitude as it is explicitly related to mass eruption rate. We investigate the effects of different atmospheric and wind profiles, allowing the input conditions to be location specific for each eruption. The use of a predictive model reduces the uncertainty in determining plume height as it retains the detail of measurements made in the field and incorporates the uncertainty in these measurements in the results, in the form of a probability distribution. We have applied this approach to fall deposits from the 1991 eruption of Pinatubo, one of the few Plinian eruptions in which the true height of the plume is well known. The predicted plume heights are in good agreement with those found from satellite measurements. This new approach provides a method for determining plume height from poorly preserved fall deposits, from which a limited amount of data can be sampled leading to large uncertainties in the field measurements.},

abstract = {The 2008–2013 eruption of Chait{\'{e}}n Volcano (Chile) was a long-lasting eruption whose climactic phase (May 6, 2008) produced a sub-Plinian plume, with height ranging between 14 and 20 km that dispersed to the NE, reaching the Atlantic coast of Argentina. The erupted material was mainly of lithic origin (∼77 wt{\%}), resulting in a unimodal total grain size distribution (TGSD) dominated by coarse ash (77 wt{\%}), with Mdϕ of 2.7 and $\sigma$ϕ of 2.4. Lapilli clasts ({\textgreater}2 mm) dominate the proximal deposit within {\~{}}20 km of the vent, while coarse (63 $\mu$m–2 mm) and fine ash ({\textless}63 $\mu$m) sedimented as far as 800 km from vent, generating mostly poly-modal grain size distributions across the entire deposit. Given that most of the mass is sedimented in proximal areas, results show that possible contributions of later explosive events to the thickness of the distal deposit where layers are less distinguishable ({\textgreater}400 km) do not significantly affect the determination of the TGSD. In contrast, gaps in data sampling in the medial deposit (in particular the gap between 50 and 350 km from vent that coincides with shifts in sedimentation regimes) have large impacts on estimates of TGSD. Particle number distribution for this deposit is characterized by a high power-law exponent (3.0) following a trend very similar to the vesicle size distribution in the juvenile pyroclasts. Although this could be taken to indicate a bubble-driven fragmentation process, we suggest that fragmentation was more likely the result of a shear-driven process because of the predominance of non-vesicular products (lithics and obsidians) and the large fraction of coarse ash in the TGSD.},

abstract = {Estimating the mass, volume, and dispersal of the deposits of very small and/or extremely weak explosive eruptions is diffi cult, unless they can be sampled on eruption. During explosive eruptions of Halema‘uma‘u Crater (Kīlauea, Hawaii) in 2008, we constrained for the fi rst time deposits of bulk volumes as small as 9–300 m3 (1 × 104 to 8 × 105 kg) and can demonstrate that they show simple exponential thinning with distance from the vent. There is no simple fi t for such products within classifi cations such as the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI). The VEI is being increasingly used as the measure of magni- tude of explosive eruptions, and as an input for both hazard modeling and forecasting of atmospheric dispersal of tephra. The 2008 deposits demonstrate a problem for the use of the VEI, as originally defi ned, which classifi es small, yet ballistic-producing, explosive eruptions at Kīlauea and other basaltic volcanoes as nonexplosive. We suggest a simple change to extend the scale in a fashion inclusive of such very small deposits, and to make the VEI more consistent with other mag- nitude scales such as the Richter scale for earthquakes. Eruptions of this magnitude constitute a signifi cant risk at Kīlauea and elsewhere because of their high frequency and the growing number of “volcano tourists” visiting basaltic volcanoes.},

abstract = {Proximal ({\textless}3 km) deposits from episodes II and III of the 60-h-long Novarupta 1912 eruption exhibit a very complex stratigraphy, the result of at least four transport regimes and diverse depositional mechanisms. They contrast with the relatively simple stratigraphy (and inferred emplacement mechanisms) for the previously documented, better known, medial–distal fall deposits and the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes ignimbrite. The proximal products include alternations and mixtures of both locally and regionally dispersed fall ejecta, and numerous thin complex deposits of pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) with no regional analogs. The locally dispersed component of the fall deposits forms sector-confined wedges of material whose thicknesses halve radially from and concentrically about the vent over distances of 100–300 m (cf. several kilometers for the medial–distal fall deposits). This locally dispersed fall material (and many of the associated PDC deposits) is rich in andesitic and banded pumices and richer in shallow-derived wall-rock lithics in comparison with the coeval medial fall units of almost entirely dacitic composition. There are no marked contrasts in grain size in the near-vent deposits, however, between locally and widely dispersed beds, and all samples of the proximal fall deposits plot as a simple continuation of grain size trends for medial–distal samples. Associated PDC deposits form a spectrum of facies from fines-poor, avalanched beds through thin-bedded, landscape-mantling beds to channelized lobes of pumice-block-rich ignimbrite. The origins of the Novarupta near-vent deposits are considered within a spectrum of four transport regimes: (1) sustained buoyant plume, (2) fountaining with co-current flow, (3) fountaining with counter-current flow, and (4) direct lateral ejection. The Novarupta deposits suggest a model where buoyant, stable, regime-1 plumes characterized most of episodes II and III, but were accompanied by transient and variable partitioning of clasts into the other three regimes. Only one short period of vent blockage and cessation of the Plinian plume occurred, separating episodes II and III, which was followed by a single PDC interpreted as an overpressured "blast" involving direct lateral ejection. In contrast, regimes 2 and 3 were reflected by spasmodic sedimentation from the margins of the jet and perhaps lower plume, which were being strongly affected by short-lived instabilities. These instabilities in turn are inferred to be associated with heterogeneities in the mixture of gas and pyroclasts emerging from the vent. Of the parameters that control explosive eruptive behavior, only such sudden and asymmetrical changes in the particle concentration could operate on time scales sufficiently short to explain the rapid changes in the proximal 1912 products.},

abstract = {The golden pumice deposit (unit K1) represents one of the latest episodes of Hawaiian fountaining in the Keanakāko‘i Tephra and is the product of the first high fountaining eruption at Kīlauea summit in {\~{}}300 yr, since the caldera formed in ca. 1500 CE. We present a new physical characterization of the deposit based on over 200 field sites, all affected by severe erosion, alteration, and silicic encrusting. We detail the deposit geometry, stratigraphic and structural relationships, and componentry to constrain its volume and reconstruct the eruptive sequence. The deposit is then discussed and set against other young episodes of high fountaining at Kīlauea.We interpret the golden pumice as the product of a days-long eruptive sequence with a source located inside a caldera much deeper than that of today. The eruption probably started along a NE-SW–oriented fissure and migrated toward a single vent in the southwestern part of the caldera, where at least two high Hawaiian-style fountains produced a tephra deposit of {\~{}}6 × 106 m3. Stratigraphic contacts reveal that erosion occurred not only between, but also during the fountaining episodes, suggesting heavy rainfall during deposition. Field observations during this study also led to the discovery of the first stratigraphic evidence that the eastern pumice postdates the golden pumice, which contributes to the new definition of the stratigraphy of the Keanakāko‘i Tephra presented in this volume.},
