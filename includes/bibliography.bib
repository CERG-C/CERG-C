  abstract = {The 2008--2013 eruption of Chait{\'e}n Volcano (Chile) was a long-lasting eruption whose climactic phase (May 6, 2008) produced a sub-Plinian plume, with height ranging between 14 and 20 km that dispersed to the NE, reaching the Atlantic coast of Argentina. The erupted material was mainly of lithic origin ({$\sim$}77 wt\%), resulting in a unimodal total grain size distribution (TGSD) dominated by coarse ash (77 wt\%), with Md{$\phi$} of 2.7 and {$\sigma\phi$} of 2.4. Lapilli clasts ({$>$}2 mm) dominate the proximal deposit within {\textasciitilde}20 km of the vent, while coarse (63 {$\mu$}m--2 mm) and fine ash ({$<$}63 {$\mu$}m) sedimented as far as 800 km from vent, generating mostly poly-modal grain size distributions across the entire deposit. Given that most of the mass is sedimented in proximal areas, results show that possible contributions of later explosive events to the thickness of the distal deposit where layers are less distinguishable ({$>$}400 km) do not significantly affect the determination of the TGSD. In contrast, gaps in data sampling in the medial deposit (in particular the gap between 50 and 350 km from vent that coincides with shifts in sedimentation regimes) have large impacts on estimates of TGSD. Particle number distribution for this deposit is characterized by a high power-law exponent (3.0) following a trend very similar to the vesicle size distribution in the juvenile pyroclasts. Although this could be taken to indicate a bubble-driven fragmentation process, we suggest that fragmentation was more likely the result of a shear-driven process because of the predominance of non-vesicular products (lithics and obsidians) and the large fraction of coarse ash in the TGSD.},

  abstract = {Eruptive column models are powerful tools for investigating the transport of volcanic gas and ash, reconstructing past explosive eruptions, and simulating future hazards. However, the evaluation of these models is challenging as it requires independent estimates of the main model inputs (e.g. mass eruption rate) and outputs (e.g. column height). There exists no database of independently estimated eruption source parameters (ESPs) that is extensive, standardized, maintained, and consensus-based. This paper introduces the Independent Volcanic Eruption Source Parameter Archive (IVESPA, ivespa.co.uk), a community effort endorsed by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior (IAVCEI) Commission on Tephra Hazard Modelling. We compiled data for 134 explosive eruptive events, spanning the 1902-2016 period, with independent estimates of: i) total erupted mass of fall deposits; ii) duration; iii) eruption column height; and iv) atmospheric conditions. Crucially, we distinguish plume top versus umbrella spreading height, and the height of ash versus sulphur dioxide injection. All parameter values provided have been vetted independently by at least two experts. Uncertainties are quantified systematically, including flags to describe the degree of interpretation of the literature required for each estimate. IVESPA also includes a range of additional parameters such as total grain size distribution, eruption style, morphology of the plume (weak versus strong), and mass contribution from pyroclastic density currents, where available. We discuss the future developments and potential applications of IVESPA and make recommendations for reporting ESPs to maximize their usability across different applications. IVESPA covers an unprecedented range of ESPs and can therefore be used to evaluate and develop eruptive column models across a wide range of conditions using a standardized dataset.},

Using 134 eruptive events from the new Independent Volcanic Eruption Source Parameter Archive (IVESPA, v1.0), we explore empirical MER-height relationships for four measures of column height: spreading level, sulfur dioxide height, and top height from direct observations and as reconstructed from deposits. These relationships show significant differences and highlight limitations of empirical models currently used in operational and research applications. The roles of atmospheric stratification, wind, and humidity remain challenging to detect across the wide range of eruptive conditions spanned in IVESPA, ultimately resulting in empirical relationships outperforming analytical models that account for atmospheric conditions. This finding highlights challenges in constraining the MER-height relation using heterogeneous observations and empirical models, which reinforces the need for improved eruption source parameter data sets and physics-based models.},

  abstract = {Aggregation processes are known to play an important role in volcanic particle dispersal and sedimentation. They are also a primary source of uncertainty in ash dispersal forecasting since fundamental questions, such as the timing and deposition dynamics of volcanic aggregates, still remain unanswered. Here, we applied a state-of-the-art combination of field and numerical strategies to characterize volcanic aggregates. We introduce a new category of aggregates observed with high-speed-high-resolution videos, namely cored clusters. Cored clusters are mostly sub-spherical fragile aggregates that have never been observed in the deposits nor on adhesive tape as they typically break at impact with the ground. They consist of a core particle (200--500{$\mu$}m) fully covered by a thick shell of particles {$<$} 90{$\mu$}m. The low preservation potential of cored clusters in ash deposits explains the poor documentation in the literature and the low consideration attributed so far. Cored clusters can also better explain the deposition of fine ash in proximal and medial regions and the polymodality observed in many ash deposits. In addition, numerical inversions show how cored clusters can rapidly form within 175s from eruption onset. Finally, our observations represent the first field-based evidence of the so-called rafting effect, in which the sedimentation of coarse ash in cored clusters is delayed due to aggregation.},

In this study we have estimated the volumes of tephra-fallout deposit that could be remobilized by rainfall-triggered lahars in association with two eruptive scenarios that have characterized the activity of La Fossa cone: a long-lasting Vulcanian cycle and a subplinian eruption. The spatial distribution and volume of tephra-fallout deposits that could potentially trigger lahars were analysed based on a combination of tephra-fallout probabilistic modelling (with TEPHRA2), slope stability modelling (with TRIGRS), field observations and geotechnical tests. Field characterization includes tephra-fallout primary deposits in the lahar initiation zones and lahar deposits both on the volcanic cone and in the ring plain. Model input data (hydraulic conductivity, friction angle, cohesion, total unit weight of the soil, saturated and residual water content) were obtained from both geotechnical tests and field measurements. In particular, hydraulic conductivity plays an important role on the stability of tephra-fallout deposits. Our parametric analysis has shown that the tephra-fallout critical thickness required to trigger a lahar for the considered rainfall event is between 20\&ndash;25\&thinsp;cm for the Vulcanian scenario, and between 10\&ndash;65\&thinsp;cm or},

  abstract = {Disasters from explosive volcanic eruptions are infrequent and experience in emergency planning and mitigation for such events remains limited. The need for urgently developing more robust methods for risk assessment and decision making in volcanic crises has become increasingly apparent as world populations continue to expand in areas of active explosive volcanism. Nowhere is this more challenging than at Vesuvius, Italy, with hundreds of thousands of people living on the flanks of one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world. We describe how a new paradigm, evidence-based volcanology, has been applied in EXPLORIS to contribute to crisis planning and management for when the volcano enters its next state of unrest, as well as in long-term land-use planning. The analytical approach we adopted enumerates and quantifies all the processes and effects of the eruptive hazards of the volcano known to influence risk, a scientific challenge that combines field data on the vulnerability of the built environment and humans in past volcanic disasters with theoretical research on the state of the volcano, and including evidence from the field on previous eruptions as well as numerical simulation modelling of eruptive processes. Formal probabilistic reasoning under uncertainty and a decision analysis approach have provided the basis for the development of an event tree for a future range of eruption types with probability paths and hypothetical casualty outcomes for risk assessment. The most likely future eruption scenarios for emergency planning were derived from the event tree and elaborated upon from the geological and historical record. Modelling the impacts in these scenarios and quantifying the consequences for the circumvesuvian area provide realistic assessments for disaster planning and for showing the potential risk-benefit of mitigation measures, the main one being timely evacuation, but include for consideration protecting buildings against dilute, low dynamic pressure surges, and temporary roof supports in the most vulnerable buildings, as well as hardening infrastructure and lifelines. This innovative work suggests that risk-based methods Could have an important role in crisis management at cities on volcanoes and small volcanic islands. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Abstract. In order to assist the elaboration of proactive measures for the management of future volcanic eruptions in Iceland, we developed a new scenario-based approach to assess the hazard associated with tephra dispersal and sedimentation at various scales and for multiple sources. The target volcanoes are Hekla, Katla, Eyjafjallaj{\"o}kull and Askja, selected either for their high probabilities of eruption and/or their high potential impact. By coupling tephrostratigraphic studies, probabilistic techniques and modelling, we developed comprehensive eruption scenarios for both short- and long-lasting eruptions and compiled hazard maps for tephra ground deposition at a national scale and air concentration at a European scale using the TEPHRA2 and FALL3D models, respectively. New algorithms for the identification of realistic sets of eruptive source parameters are investigated, which assist the generation of probability density functions of eruption source parameters for the selected scenarios. Aggregation processes were accounted for using various empirical models. Outcomes, i.e. probabilities conditioned to the occurrence of an eruption, help the assessment and comparison of hazard levels at different scales. For example, at a national scale Askja has a 5--10\% probability of blanketing the easternmost half of the country with a tephra accumulation of at least 1 kg m-2. At a continental scale, Katla has a 5--10\% probability of producing ash clouds with concentrations of 2 mg m-3 over the UK, Scandinavia and northern Europe with a mean arrival time of 48--72 h and a mean persistence time of 6--18 h. In a companion paper, Scaini et al. (2014) present a vulnerability assessment for Iceland to ground deposition of tephra and for the European air traffic to airborne ash which, combined with the outcomes of the present paper, constitute one of the first comprehensive multi-scale risk assessment associated with tephra dispersal and sedimentation.},

  abstract = {We present a probabilistic approach to quantify the hazard posed by volcanic ballistic projectiles (VBP) and their potential impact on the built environment. A model named Great Balls of Fire (GBF) is introduced to describe ballistic trajectories of VBPs accounting for a variable drag coefficient and topography. It relies on input parameters easily identifiable in the field and is designed to model large numbers of VBPs stochastically. Associated functions come with the GBF code to post-process model outputs into a comprehensive probabilistic hazard assessment for VBP impacts. Outcomes include probability maps to exceed given thresholds of kinetic energies at impact, hazard curves and probabilistic isoenergy maps. Probabilities are calculated either on equally-sized pixels or zones of interest. The approach is calibrated, validated and applied to La Fossa volcano, Vulcano Island (Italy). We constructed a generic eruption scenario based on stratigraphic studies and numerical inversions of the 1888--1890 long-lasting Vulcanian cycle of La Fossa. Results suggest a {\textasciitilde}10-2\% probability of occurrence of VBP impacts with kinetic energies {$\leq$}104 J at the touristic locality of Porto. In parallel, the vulnerability to roof perforation was estimated by combining field observations and published literature, allowing for a first estimate of the potential impact of VBPs during future Vulcanian eruptions. Results indicate a high physical vulnerability to the VBP hazard, and, consequently, half of the building stock having a {$\geq$}2.5{\texttimes}10-3\% probability of roof perforation.},

Eruption scenarios are based upon the stratigraphy produced by the last 1000 years of activity at Vulcano and include long--lasting Vulcanian and sub-Plinian eruptions. A new method is proposed to quantify the evolution through time of the hazard associated with pulsatory Vulcanian eruptions lasting from weeks to years, and the increase in hazard related to typical rainfall events around Sicily is also accounted for. The impact assessment on the roofs is performed by combining a field characterization of the buildings with the composite European vulnerability curves for typical roofing stocks. Results show that a sub-Plinian eruption of VEI 2 is not likely to affect buildings, whereas a sub-Plinian eruption of VEI 3 results in 90 \% of the building stock having a {$\geq$}12 \% probability of collapse. The hazard related to long-lasting Vulcanian eruptions evolves through time, and our analysis shows that the town of Il Piano, located downwind of the preferential wind patterns, is likely to reach critical tephra accumulations for roof collapse 5--9 months after the onset of the eruption. If no cleaning measures are taken, half of the building stock has a probability {$>$}20 \% of suffering roof collapse.},

An eruption scenario is identified based on the field characterization of the last subplinian eruption at Sakurajima and a review of reports of the eruptions that occurred in the past six centuries. A scenario-based probabilistic hazard assessment is performed using the Tephra2 model, considering various eruption durations to reflect complex eruptive sequences of all considered reference eruptions. A quantitative exposure analysis of infrastructures and lifelines is presented primarily using open-access data. The post-event impact assessment of Magill et al. (Earth Planets Space 65:677--698, 2013) after the 2011 VEI 2 eruption of Shinmoedake is used to discuss the vulnerability and the resilience of infrastructures during a future large eruption of Sakurajima. Results indicate a main eastward dispersal, with longer eruption durations increasing the probability of tephra accumulation in proximal areas and reducing it in distal areas. The exposure analysis reveals that 2300 km of road network, 18 km2 of urban area, and 306 km2 of agricultural land have a 50\% probability of being affected by an accumulation of tephra of 1 kg/m2. A simple qualitative exposure analysis suggests that the municipalities of Kagoshima, Kanoya, and Tarumizu are the most likely to suffer impacts. Finally, the 2011 VEI 2 eruption of Shinmoedake demonstrated that the already implemented mitigation strategies have increased resilience and improved recovery of affected infrastructures. Nevertheless, the extent to which these mitigation actions will perform during the VEI 4 eruption presented here is unclear and our hazard assessment points to possible damages on the Sakurajima peninsula and the neighboring municipality of Tarumizu.},

We present a new physical characterization of the deposit based on over 200 field sites, all affected by severe erosion, alteration, and silicic encrusting. We detail the deposit geometry, stratigraphic and structural relationships, and componentry to constrain its volume and reconstruct the eruptive sequence. The deposit is then discussed and set against other young episodes of high fountaining at K{\=i}lauea.We interpret the golden pumice as the product of a days-long eruptive sequence with a source located inside a caldera much deeper than that of today. The eruption probably started along a NE-SW--oriented fissure and migrated toward a single vent in the southwestern part of the caldera, where at least two high Hawaiian-style fountains produced a tephra deposit of {\textasciitilde}6 {\texttimes} 106 m3. Stratigraphic contacts reveal that erosion occurred not only between, but also during the fountaining episodes, suggesting heavy rainfall during deposition. Field observations during this study also led to the discovery of the first stratigraphic evidence that the eastern pumice postdates the golden pumice, which contributes to the new definition of the stratigraphy of the Keanak{\=a}ko`i Tephra presented in this volume.},

The portion of the flow located on K?lauea's coastal plain was characterized using helicopter-based visible and thermal structure-from-motion photogrammetry to construct a series of georeferenced digital surface models and thermal maps on 8 different days. Results reveal key influences on the emplacement and evolution of such long-lived p?hoehoe flows. This region of the flow grew by {\textasciitilde}12?106 m3 with a near-constant time-average discharge rate of 1.2-2.7 m3/s. The development of two tube systems is captured and shows an initial nascent tube enhanced by a narrow topographic confinement, which later inflated and created a topographic inversion that modulated the emplacement of a second flow lobe with its own tube system. The analysis of breakouts at various stages of the field's life suggests that the evolution of the thermal and morphological properties of the flow surface reflect its maturity. Thermal properties of breakouts were used to expand the empirical relationship of breakout cooling to longer time scales. This study contributes to the long-term development and the validation of more accurate predictive models for p?hoehoe, required during the management of long-lasting lava flow crises in Hawai'i and elsewhere.},

  abstract = {Effective risk management requires accurate assessment of population exposure to volcanic hazards. Assessment of this exposure at the large-scale has often relied on circular footprints of various sizes around a volcano to simplify challenges associated with estimating the directionality and distribution of the intensity of volcanic hazards. However, to date, exposure values obtained from circular footprints have never been compared with modelled hazard footprints. Here, we compare hazard and population exposure estimates calculated from concentric radii of 10, 30 and 100 km with those calculated from the simulation of dome- and column-collapse pyroclastic density currents (PDCs), large clasts, and tephra fall across Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) 3, 4 and 5 scenarios for 40 volcanoes in Indonesia and the Philippines. We found that a 10 km radius---considered by previous studies to capture hazard footprints and populations exposed for VEI\,{$\leq$}\,3 eruptions---generally overestimates the extent for most simulated hazards, except for column collapse PDCs. A 30 km radius -- considered representative of life-threatening VEI\,{$\leq$}\,4 hazards---overestimates the extent of PDCs and large clasts but underestimates the extent of tephra fall. A 100 km radius encapsulates most simulated life-threatening hazards, although there are exceptions for certain combinations of scenario, source parameters, and volcano. In general, we observed a positive correlation between radii- and model-derived population exposure estimates in southeast Asia for all hazards except dome collapse PDC, which is very dependent upon topography. This study shows, for the first time, how and why concentric radii under- or overestimate hazard extent and population exposure, providing a benchmark for interpreting radii-derived hazard and exposure estimates.},

  abstract = {The simultaneous or sequential occurrence of several hazards---be they of natural or anthropogenic sources---can interact to produce unexpected compound hazards and impacts. Since success in responding to volcanic crises is often conditional on accurate identification of spatiotemporal patterns of hazard prior to an eruption, ignoring these interactions can lead to a misrepresentation or misinterpretation of the risk and, during emergencies, ineffective management priorities. The 2021 eruption of Tajogaite volcano on the island of La Palma, Canary Islands (Spain), was an 86 day-long hybrid explosiveeffusive eruption that demonstrated the challenges of managing volcanic crises associated with the simultaneous emission of lava, tephra and volcanic gases. Here, we present the result of a small-scale impact assessment conducted during three-field deployments to investigate how tephra fallout and lava flow inundation interacted to cause compound physical impact on buildings. The study area was a neighbourhood of 30 buildings exposed to tephra fallout during the entire eruption and by a late-stage, short-lived lava flow. Observations highlight, on one hand, the influence of clean-up operations and rainfall on the impact of tephra fallout and, on the other hand, the importance of the dynamics of lava flow emplacement in controlling impact mechanisms. Overall, results provide an evidence-based insight into impact sequences when two primary hazards are produced simultaneously and demonstrate the importance of considering this aspect when implementing risk mitigation strategies for future long-lasting, hybrid explosive-effusive eruptions in urban environments.},

Forecasting the future path and/or behavior of an active lava flow is challenging because topography is often poorly constrained and lava has a complex rheology and emplacement history. Preserved lavas are an important source of information which, combined with observations of active flows, underpins conceptual models of lava flow emplacement. However, the value of preserved lavas is limited because pre-eruptive topography and, thus, syneruptive lava flow geometry are usually not known. Here, we use tree-mold data to constrain pre-eruptive topography and syn-eruptive lava flow geometry of the July 1974 flow of K{\=i}lauea (USA). Tree molds, which are formed after advancing lava encloses standing trees, preserve the lava inundation height and the final preserved thickness of lava. We used data from 282 tree molds to reconstruct the temporal and spatial evolution of the\,{\textasciitilde}\,2.1 km-long July 1974 flow. The tree mold dataset yields a detailed dynamic picture of staged emplacement, separated by intervals of ponding. In some ponded areas, flow depth during emplacement ({\textasciitilde}\,5 m) was twice the preserved thickness of the final lava (2--3 m). Drainage of the ponds led to episodic surges in flow advancement, decoupled from fluctuations in vent discharge rate. We infer that the final breakout occurred after the cessation of fountaining. Such complex emplacement histories may be common for p{\=a}hoehoe lavas at K{\=i}lauea and elsewhere in situations where the terrain is of variable slope, and/or where lava is temporarily perched and stored.},

The first two mechanisms contributed most of the tephra-fallout deposits (minimum total dense-rock equivalent volume of 23 x 106 m3), which vary from massive to layered and represent the amalgamation of the deposits from a large numbers of events. The volume of co-pyroclastic-flow fallout tephra is in the range 4-16{$^\circ$} of the associated pyroclastic flow deposits. Dome-collapse fallout tephra is characterized by ash particles generated by fragmentation in the pyroclastic flows and by elutriation of fines. Vulcanian fallout tephra is coarser grained, as it is formed by magma fragmentation in the conduit and by elutriation from the fountain-collapse flows and initial surges. Vulcanian fallout tephra is typically polymodal, whereas dome-collapse fallout tephra is predominantly unimodal. Polymodality is attributed to: overlapping of fallout tephra of different types, premature fallout of fine particles, multiple tephra-fallout sources, and differences in density and grain-size distribution of different components. During both dome collapses and explosions, ash fell as aggregates of various sizes and types. Accretionary lapilli grain size is independent of their diameter and is characterized by multiple subpopulations with a main mode at 5{\o}. Satellite data indicate that very fine ash can stay in a volcanic cloud for several hours and show that exponential thinning rates observed in proximal areas cannot apply in distal areas.},

Eruptive activity during 4\&\#8211;8 May 2010 was characterized based on short-duration physical parameters in order to capture transient eruptive behavior of a long-lasting eruption (i.e., total grain-size distribution, erupted mass, and mass eruption rate averaged over 30 min activity). The resulting 30 min total grain-size distribution based on both ground and Meteosat Second Generation-Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (MSG-SEVIRI) satellite measurements is characterized by Mdphi of about 2 \${\textbackslash}phi\$ and a fine-ash content of about 30 wt \%. The accumulation rate varied by 2 orders of magnitude with an exponential decay away from the vent, whereas Mdphi shows a linear increase until about 18 km from the vent, reaching a plateau of about 4.5 \${\textbackslash}phi\$ between 20 and 56 km. The associated mass eruption rate is between 0.6 and 1.2 {\dbend} 105 kg s\&\#8722;1. In situ sampling showed how fine ash mainly fell as aggregates of various typologies. About 5 to 9 wt \% of the erupted mass remained in the cloud up to 1000 km from the vent, suggesting that nearly half of the ash \&gt;7\${\textbackslash}phi\$ settled as aggregates within the first 60 km. Particle sphericity and shape factor varied between 0.4 and 1 with no clear correlation to the size and distance from vent. Our experiments also demonstrate how satellite retrievals and Doppler radar grain-size detection can provide a real-time description of the source term but for a limited particle-size range.},

  abstract = {Regardless of the recent advances in geophysical monitoring and real-time quantitative observations of explosive volcanic eruptions, the characterization of tephra deposits remains one of the largest sources of information on Eruption Source Parameters (ESPs) (i.e. plume height, erupted volume/mass, Mass Eruption Rate --- MER, eruption duration, Total Grain-Size Distribution --- TGSD). ESPs are crucial for the characterization of volcanic systems and for the compilation of comprehensive hazard scenarios but are naturally associated with various degrees of uncertainties that are traditionally not well quantified. Recent studies have highlighted the uncertainties associated with the estimation of ESPs mostly related to: i) the intrinsic variability of the natural system, ii) the observational error and iii) the strategies used to determine physical parameters. Here we review recent studies focused on the characterization of these uncertainties and we present a sensitivity analysis for the determination of ESPs and a systematic investigation to quantify the propagation of uncertainty applied to two case studies. In particular, we highlight the dependence of ESPs on specific observations used as input parameters (i.e. diameter of the largest clasts, thickness measurements, area of isopach contours, deposit density, downwind and crosswind range of isopleth maps, and empirical constants and wind speed for the determination of MER). The highest uncertainty is associated to the estimation of MER and eruption duration and is related to the determination of crosswind range of isopleth maps and the empirical constants used in the empirical parameterization relating MER and plume height. Given the exponential nature of the relation between MER and plume height, the propagation of uncertainty is not symmetrical, and both an underestimation of the empirical constant and an overestimation of plume height have the highest impact on the final outcome. A {\textpm}20\% uncertainty on thickness measurements, area of isopach contours, integration limit for the power-law fit and deposit density result in ESP uncertainties {$\leq\pm$}20\% for plume height and erupted volume/mass. Finally, a third case study has also been used to explore the sensitivity of the Voronoi Tessellation strategy for the determination of TGSD and the inversion on both mass/area and grain-size data for the determination of erupted mass and plume height. Results confirm the validity of the methods but also the strong dependence on the distribution and number of observations.},

Tephra dispersal and sedimentation mostly depends on particle characteristics, atmospheric conditions, and plume dynamics, with the potential of affecting the environment and society at multiple scales. In particular, thinning trends of tephra deposits mostly depend on particle Reynolds number, which defines different fallout regimes. Nonetheless, particle--particle interactions (e.g., particle aggregation) and gravitational instabilities can strongly affect the particle residence time in the atmosphere promoting premature fallout of the finest fraction ({$<$}100 {$\mu$}m). Several analytical and numerical models have been developed to describe both particle transport and settling with the intent of better understanding dispersal dynamics, quantifying the associated hazards, and determining the main eruption source parameters by solving inverse problems. A full characterization of tephra dispersal and sedimentation can only be achieved through a critical synergy of multiple approaches.},

  abstract = {Classifications of volcanic eruptions were first introduced in the early twentieth century mostly based on qualitative observations of eruptive activity, and over time, they have gradually been developed to incorporate more quantitative descriptions of the eruptive products from both deposits and observations of active volcanoes. Progress in physical volcanology, and increased capability in monitoring, measuring and modelling of explosive eruptions, has highlighted shortcomings in the way we classify eruptions and triggered a debate around the need for eruption classification and the advantages and disadvantages of existing classification schemes. Here, we (i) review and assess existing classification schemes, focussing on subaerial eruptions; (ii) summarize the fundamental processes that drive and parameters that characterize explosive volcanism; (iii) identify and prioritize the main research that will improve the understanding, characterization and classification of volcanic eruptions and (iv) provide a roadmap for producing a rational and comprehensive classification scheme. In particular, classification schemes need to be objective-driven and simple enough to permit scientific exchange and promote transfer of knowledge beyond the scientific community. Schemes should be comprehensive and encompass a variety of products, eruptive styles and processes, including for example, lava flows, pyroclastic density currents, gas emissions and cinder cone or caldera formation. Open questions, processes and parameters that need to be addressed and better characterized in order to develop more comprehensive classification schemes and to advance our understanding of volcanic eruptions include conduit processes and dynamics, abrupt transitions in eruption regime, unsteadiness, eruption energy and energy balance.},

In this context, impact analyses have already provided fundamental insights into the vulnerability of various elements and systems and are essential to identifying important drivers of losses.

The output of risk assessment in the ADVISE model is expressed in terms of potential physical, functional, and systemic damage, determined by combining the available information on hazard, exposed systems and vulnerability. The ADVISE model permits qualitative, semi-quantitative and quantitative risk assessment depending on the final objective and on the available information. The proposed approach has evolved over a decade of study on the volcanic island of Vulcano (Italy), where recent signs of unrest combined with uncontrolled urban development and significant seasonal variations of exposed population result in highly dynamic volcanic risk. For the sake of illustration of all the steps of the ADVISE model, we focus here on the risk assessment of the transport system in relation to the tephra fallout associated with a long-lasting Vulcanian cycle.},

Evacuation planning and management represent a key aspect of volcanic crises because they can increase people's protection as well as minimize potential impacts on the economy, properties and infrastructure of the affected area. We present an agent-based simulation tool that assesses the effectiveness of different evacuation scenarios using the small island of Vulcano (southern Italy) as a case study. Simulation results show that the overall time needed to evacuate people should be analysed together with the percentage of people evacuated as a function of time and that a simultaneous evacuation on Vulcano is more efficient than a staged evacuation. For example, during the touristic (high) season between July and August, even though the overall duration is similar for both evacuation strategies, after {$\sim$}\,6\,h about 96\,\% of people would be evacuated with a simultaneous evacuation, while only 86\,\% would be evacuated with a staged evacuation. We also present a model to assess the economic impact of evacuation as a function of evacuation duration and of the starting period with respect to the touristic season. It reveals that if an evacuation lasting 3~to 6~months was initiated at the beginning or at the end of the touristic season (i.e. June or November), it would cause a very different economic impact on the tourism industry (about 78\,\%--88\,\% and 2\,\%--7\,\% of the total annual turnover, respectively). Our results show how the assessment of evacuation scenarios that consider human and economic impact carried out in a pre-disaster context helps authorities develop evacuation plans and make informed decisions outside the highly stressful time period that characterizes crises.},

The 2021 Tajogaite eruption of La Palma, Canary Islands, was associated with a magma-gas decoupled system that resulted in the simultaneous emission of lava flows and tephra plumes from various vents. Even though the tephra blanket ({$\sim$}2 {\texttimes} 10{$\mkern1mu$}7 m{$\mkern1mu$}3) represents only 7\%--16\% of the total erupted volume, it provides fundamental insights into the overall eruptive dynamics. Tephra was mostly dispersed NE-SW due to a complex regional and local wind patterns and was subdivided into 3 units and 11 layers that well correlate at different distances from the vent and with both tremor data and lava emission rate. While plume height varied at the temporal scale of a few hours, the average mass eruption rate associated with the tephra blanket of the different units remained relatively constant ({$\sim$}3--4 {\texttimes} 10{$\mkern1mu$}3 kg s{$\mkern1mu-$}1). In contrast, the emission rate of lava largely increased after the first week and remained higher than the overall emission of tephra throughout the whole eruption (average value of {$\sim$}6 {\texttimes} 10{$\mkern1mu$}4 kg s{$\mkern1mu-$}1). Based on a detailed characterization of the tephra blanket in combination with atmospheric wind, tremor, and lava emission trend, we demonstrate the need of (a) multidisciplinary strategies for the description of hybrid eruptions that account for both the duration of individual phases and the quantification of the mass of multiple products, and of (b) dedicated ash dispersal forecasting strategies that account for the frequent variations of eruptive and atmospheric conditions.},

Applying a novel least-squares method, the bulk grain-size distribution, the total mass, and the eruption column height were obtained by fitting the computed ground load and granulometries with the observed ones. The analysis of the effect of three different weighting factors in the minimization procedure was also performed. Results showed that the statistical weighting factor produced the minimum bias. The best correlation between calculated and measured deposit was found, even though the quantity of the input data was not very high, as it commonly occurs for several ancient eruptions. Model results were also in agreement with estimations provided by other independent methods.},

  abstract = {Calderas are sub-circular, polygonal or elongate subsidence basins formed by the withdrawal of magma from subvolcanic reservoirs. They are abundant on Earth and other terrestrial planets, and occur at volcanoes of most compositions and in most volcanic settings. Silicic calderas collapse catastrophically during large ignimbrite-forming explosive eruptions accompanied by landslides and avalanches. These are amongst the most hazardous events to affect the Earth's surface. They are recorded by caldera-forming eruption sequences, both around the caldera (outflow sheets) and within it (thick caldera-fills). Exhumed, old calderas expose the fills of ignimbrite, megabreccia, and fluvio-lacustrine deposits, and also the foundered caldera floor, together with the eruption-conduits and caldera-floor structures, such as peripheral inward tilting, multiple arcuate reverse and normal faults, circumferential graben and dilational crevasses; these features are concealed at less-dissected active volcanoes. Calderas may host caldera lakes and post-collapse lavas, domes, cones, intrusions, and hydrothermal systems, which provide geothermal and mineral resources. Some calderas undergo magmatic-induced uplift before and after collapse, and are sites of episodic unrest (deformation, seismic, and hydrothermal activity).},

  abstract = {Tephra deposits retain a considerable amount of information about the nature of volcanic eruptions, with plume height commonly inferred from maximum clast size measurements. However, current methods for inferring plume height from maximum clast size lose some of the accuracy in measurements made in the field and have limited application when trying to constrain the uncertainty in these parameters. Here a predictive numerical model is used to determine plume height from maximum clast size found in a deposit. Plume height is an essential parameter for inferring eruption magnitude as it is explicitly related to mass eruption rate. We investigate the effects of different atmospheric and wind profiles, allowing the input conditions to be location specific for each eruption. The use of a predictive model reduces the uncertainty in determining plume height as it retains the detail of measurements made in the field and incorporates the uncertainty in these measurements in the results, in the form of a probability distribution. We have applied this approach to fall deposits from the 1991 eruption of Pinatubo, one of the few Plinian eruptions in which the true height of the plume is well known. The predicted plume heights are in good agreement with those found from satellite measurements. This new approach provides a method for determining plume height from poorly preserved fall deposits, from which a limited amount of data can be sampled leading to large uncertainties in the field measurements.},

  abstract = {Identifying the most complete (best recorded) portion of an eruption record is essential before estimating eruption recurrence and probability. This is typically achieved by plotting cumulative eruptions through time. Here, we evaluate eruption data completeness from a new perspective, by compiling the first dated Holocene eruption from each volcano in the Volcanoes of the World (VOTW) database (i.e., First Recorded EruptionS in the Holocene (FRESH)). In our first analysis, we compared the subregional distribution of FRESH with time using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K--S) test. We found that the eruption record was best categorised into 31 regions con\- taining subregions with similar degrees of completeness. This opened the way to define new Relative Completeness Date(s) (RCD) as a function of eruption size, volcanic characteristics, and region, by identifying multiple points in the record where the root-mean-square (RMS) level changes abruptly, corresponding to a gap, a decrease or increase in the FRESH rate. Regional RCDs in the Common Era (CE) range from as recently as 1964 CE in the Indian Ocean (southern) to 200 CE in Middle East and Western Indian Ocean. In contrast, some regions like Kamchatka and Mainland Asia have near-constant rates of FRESH over the last 12,000 years, making RCDs impossible to assign. We present and make available our FRESH database, and describe and implement an automatic approach to detect RCDs across our newly defined volcanic regions. We suggest that the different degrees of completeness observed at a regional scale can be explained by: socio-historical events, access to geological studies, submarine volcanism, and/or remoteness. The FRESH database, together with the new regions and proposed RCDs can be used in future studies to estimate eruption probabilities at volcanoes without Ho\- locene records and identify which subregions are most likely to produce a FRESH in the future.},

  abstract = {Determining the eruption frequency-Magnitude (               f               -M) relationship for data-limited volcanoes is challenging since it requires a comprehensive eruption record of the past eruptive activity. This is the case for Melimoyu, a long-dormant and data-limited volcano in the Southern Volcanic Zone (SVZ) in Chile with only two confirmed Holocene eruptions (VEI 5). To supplement the eruption records, we identified analogue volcanoes for Melimoyu (i.e., volcanoes that behave similarly and are identified through shared characteristics) using a quantitative and objective approach. Firstly, we compiled a global database containing 181 variables describing the eruptive history, tectonic setting, rock composition, and morphology of 1,428 volcanoes. This database was filtered primarily based on data availability into an input dataset comprising 37 numerical variables for 438 subduction zone volcanoes. Then, we applied Agglomerative Nesting, a bottom-up hierarchical clustering algorithm on three datasets derived from the input dataset: 1) raw data, 2) output from a Principal Component Analysis, and 3) weighted data tuned to minimise the dispersion in the absolute probability per VEI. Lastly, we identified the best set of analogues by analysing the dispersion in the absolute probability per VEI and applying a set of criteria deemed important by the local geological service, SERNAGEOMIN, and VB. Our analysis shows that the raw data generate a low dispersion and the highest number of analogues (n = 20). More than half of these analogues are in the SVZ, suggesting that the tectonic setting plays a key role in the clustering analysis. The eruption               f-               M relationship modelled from the analogue's eruption data shows that if Melimoyu has an eruption, there is a 49\% probability (50th percentile) of it being VEI{$\geq$}4. Meanwhile, the annual absolute probability of a VEI{$\leq$}1, VEI 2, VEI 3, VEI 4, and VEI{$\geq$}5 eruption at Melimoyu is 4.82 {\texttimes} 10               -4               , 1.2 {\texttimes} 10               -3               , 1.45 {\texttimes} 10               -4               , 9.77 {\texttimes} 10               -4               , and 8.3 {\texttimes} 10               -4               (50th percentile), respectively. Our work shows the importance of using numerical variables to capture the variability across volcanoes and combining quantitative approaches with expert knowledge to assess the suitability of potential analogues. Additionally, this approach allows identifying groups of analogues and can be easily applied to other cases using numerical variables from the global database. Future work will use the analogues to populate an event tree and define eruption source parameters for modelling volcanic hazards at Melimoyu.},

Fall deposits, however, contain two distinct populations of pyroclasts: juvenile, i.e., magmatic clasts fragmented from the magma, and wall-rock particles derived from walls of the vent and volcanic conduit. While sizes and shapes of the former are always sensitive indicators of eruptive processes, properties of the wall-rock population may refl ect various external infl uences. Here we describe how the wall-rock component of a powerful historical eruption largely inherited its size distribution from properties of the host rocks, and how this, in turn, strongly biases the entire deposit grain size distribution of the near-vent deposits. The use of wall-rock particles to infer style of fragmentation and eruption must always be coupled with other independent lines of evidence.}

Eruption forecasts are expressed in terms of probability of the timing of volcanic eruptions, their likely locations, magnitudes and products. Prior to observing volcanic unrest, forecasts are often articulated in terms of long-term volcanic hazard assessments that rely primarily on the distribution and nature of past volcanic events. Methods are presented to assess recurrence rates of volcanic eruptions, especially using steady-state Poisson and non-Poissonian renewal models. Tests are provided for steady-state eruption recurrence rate and model comparison methods using the Akaike Information Criterion. Potential locations of new volcanic vents may be estimated using nonparametric kernel density methods and combined with numerical simulations of volcanic processes, such as the dispersion of tephra and lava flow emplacement, to create hazard curves for specific locations and hazard maps for specific areas. These tools are incorporated into a Bayesian framework for estimating volcanic hazards using event trees, with the important result that a wide range of potential eruption consequences may be visualized and evaluated.},

  abstract = {The Total Grain-Size Distribution (TGSD) of tephra deposits is crucial for hazard assessment and provides fundamental insights into eruption dynamics. It controls both the mass distribution within the eruptive plume and the sedimentation processes and can provide essential information on the fragmentation mechanisms. TGSD is typically calculated by integrating deposit grain-size at different locations. The result of such integration is affected not only by the number, but also by the spatial distribution and distance from the vent of the sampling sites. In order to evaluate the reliability of TGSDs, we assessed representative sampling distances for pyroclasts of different sizes through dedicated numerical simulations of tephra dispersal. Results reveal that, depending on wind conditions, a representative grain-size distribution of tephra deposits down to 100 {$\mu$}m can be obtained by integrating samples collected at distances from less than one tenth up to a few tens of the column height. The statistical properties of TGSDs representative of a range of eruption styles were calculated by fitting the data with a few general distributions given by the sum of two log-normal distributions (bi-Gaussian in {$\Phi$}-units), the sum of two Weibull distributions, and a generalized log-logistic distribution for the cumulative number distributions. The main parameters of the bi-lognormal fitting correlate with height of the eruptive columns and magma viscosity, allowing general relationships to be used for estimating TGSD generated in a variety of eruptive styles and for different magma compositions. Fitting results of the cumulative number distribution show two different power law trends for coarse and fine fractions of tephra particles, respectively.Our results shed light on the complex processes that control the size of particles being injected into the atmosphere during volcanic explosive eruptions and represent the first attempt to assess TGSD on the basis of pivotal physical quantities, such as magma viscosity and plume height. Our empirical method can be used to assess the main features of TGSD necessary for numerical simulations aimed to real-time forecasting and long-term hazard assessment when more accurate field-derived TGSDs are not available.},

AshCalc provides a simple and intuitive tool to speed up the analysis of tephra deposits and compare and contrast the fits for each model. Two improvements in terms of computational performance are implemented in AshCalc for the estimation of the parameters for the Weibull model. The first is an analytic method for reducing the number of free parameters, whilst the second exaggerates the minima in parameter space, leading to a more robust solution. We show that AshCalc provides volume estimates in line with other previously published estimates and hence can be used with a high degree of confidence. We include the open source python code for Ashcalc with the intention that it can be used both as a stand-alone program and integrated into other python projects.},

Co-PDC deposits have a remarkably consistent grain size that remains constant with distance from source, regardless of eruption style, highlighting the complex sedimentation mechanisms that control deposition of co-PDC ash due to its fine grain size. Observations and numerical simulations of co-PDC onset emphasize the role played by the dynamics of PDCs in the development of co-PDC columns and plumes. The key differences between co-PDC and vent-derived plume source conditions and dispersion dynamics have important implications for application of remote sensing and numerical modeling methods.},

  abstract = {On March 19, 2008 a small explosive event accompanied the opening of a 35-m-wide vent (Overlook vent) on the southeast wall of Halema`uma`u Crater in K{\=i}lauea Caldera, initiating an eruptive period that extends to the time of writing. The peak of activity, in 2008, consisted of alternating background open-system outgassing and spattering punctuated by sudden, short-lived weak explosions, triggered by collapses of the walls of the vent and conduit. Near-daily sampling of the tephra from this open system, along with exceptionally detailed observations, allow us to study the dynamics of the activity during two eruptive sequences in late 2008. Each sequence includes background activity preceding and following one or more explosions in September and October 2008 respectively. Componentry analyses were performed for daily samples to characterise the diversity of the ejecta. Nine categories of pyroclasts were identified in all the samples, including wall-rock fragments. The six categories of juvenile clasts can be grouped in three classes based on vesicularity: (1) poorly, (2) uniformly highly to extremely, and (3) heterogeneously highly vesicular. The wall-rock and juvenile clasts show dissimilar grainsize distributions, reflecting different fragmentation mechanisms. The wall-rock particles formed by failure of the vent and conduit walls above the magma free surface and were then passively entrained in the eruptive plume. The juvenile componentry reveals consistent contrasts in degassing and fragmentation processes before, during and after the explosive events. We infer a crude `layering' developed in the shallow melt, in terms of both rheology and bubble and volatile contents, beneath a convecting free surface during background activity. A tens-of-centimetres thick viscoelastic surface layer was effectively outgassed and relatively cool, while at depths of less than 100 m, the melt remained slightly supersaturated in volatiles and actively vesiculating. Decoupled metre-sized bubbles rising through the column burst through the free surface frequently, ejecting fragments of the outgassed upper layer. When the surface was abruptly perturbed by the rock-falls, existing mm-sized bubbles expanded, leading to the acceleration of adjacent melt upward and consecutive explosions, while renewed nucleation created a minor population of 10-micron-sized bubbles. After each explosive event in September--October 2008, this layering was re-established but with decreasing vigour, suggesting that the magma batch as a whole was becoming progressively depleted in dissolved volatiles.},

Housing unit data at the block level from the 1990 to 2010 decennial censuses are used to estimate housing unit exposure to floods using a binary dasymetric and proportional allocation method. Three different representations of the 100-year (1 percent annual chance) and 500-year (0.2 percent annual chance) floodplain are employed: the generally more conservative floodplains created using the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Hazus-MH software, the generally more extensive floodplains included in the proprietary Flood Hazard Data product from KatRisk LLC and the regulatory floodplains from the National Flood Insurance Program. The number of housing units within both the 100and 500-year floodplain increased from 1990 to 2010 throughout the Atlanta region. Housing unit growth within the regulatory 100-year flood zone was slower than growth elsewhere, suggesting that the National Flood Insurance Program may have been marginally effective overall. Results using the KatRisk product reveal both greater overall and a greater increase in housing units at risk within the 100-year floodplain than the regulatory product suggests. The results argue that heightened flood exposure, particularly in areas experiencing new development, is an important factor to consider when addressing the impact of the flood hazard over time.},

The loose volcaniclastic cover rests on an almost impermeable substratum, which comprises a fine-grained hydromagmatic tuff. Morphologically, three sectors were distinguished: 1) a water supply zone (slope{$>$}32{$^\circ$}) where rain water is enriched in mud and concentrated in the initiation zone; 2) an initiation zone (or source area sensu stricto slope with {$\sim$}30{$^\circ$}) where debris flows form and; 3) a transport and deposition zone where debris flows deposited levees and terminal lobes (slope {$\sim$}30{$^\circ$}). Main episodes of erosion of loose volcaniclastic cover and debris flow generation occur in response to thunderstorms. The erosion of tuff from superficial water added a significant amount of fines (mud fraction) to the initiating flows. Debris flow stoppage on steep slopes was interpreted as the result of a loss of mass (estimated between 35\% and 53\% of total mass) to form levees. From field and laboratory data the density of debris flows was estimated at about 1950 kg/m3. Morphological data, matrix texture, mass number (Nm) and clay content of debris flow deposits suggest that they were deposited by saturated granular slurries.},

The method using straight lines on plots of log thickness versus area 1/2 is the most geologically reasonable because most deposits thin exponentially from source and therefore plot as straight lines using these coordinates. Errors and uncertainties in previous derivations for using this method are discussed and more general formulas presented.

  abstract = {On 6 August, 2012, Upper Te Maari Crater, Tongariro volcano, New Zealand, erupted for the first time in over one hundred years. Multiple vents were activated during the hydrothermal eruption, ejecting blocks up to 2.3km and impacting{\textasciitilde}2.6km of the Tongariro Alpine Crossing (TAC) hiking track. Ballistic impact craters were mapped to calibrate a 3D ballistic trajectory model for the eruption. This was further used to inform future ballistic hazard. Orthophoto mapping revealed 3,587 impact craters with a mean diameter of 2.4m. However, field mapping of accessible regions indicated an average of at least four times more observable impact craters and a smaller mean crater diameter of 1.2m. By combining the orthophoto and ground-truthed impact frequency and size distribution data, we estimate that approximately 13,200 ballistic projectiles were generated during the eruption. The 3D ballistic trajectory model and a series of inverse models were used to constrain the eruption directions, angles and velocities. When combined with eruption observations and geophysical observations, the model indicates that the blocks were ejected in five variously directed eruption pulses, in total lasting 19seconds. The model successfully reproduced the mapped impact distribution using a mean initial particle velocity of 200m/s with an accompanying average gas flow velocity over a 400m radius of 150m/s. We apply the calibrated model to assess ballistic hazard from the August eruption along the TAC. By taking the field mapped spatial density of impacts and an assumption that an average ballistic impact will cause serious injury or death (casualty) over an 8m2 area, we estimate that the probability of casualty ranges from 1\% to 16\% along the affected track (assuming an eruption during the time of exposure). Future ballistic hazard and probabilities of casualty along the TAC are also assessed through application of the calibrated model. We model a magnitude larger eruption and illustrate that the probability of casualty could reach 100\% in localised areas of the track. In contrast, ballistics ejected from a smaller eruption did not reach the track as was the case with the 21 November 2012 eruption. The calibrated ballistic model can therefore be used to improve management of ballistic hazards both at Tongariro and also, once recalibrated, to other volcanoes worldwide.},

Ash fallout disrupts airport operations, while the presence of airborne ash at low altitudes near airports affects visibility and the safety of landing and take-off operations. Low concentrations of ash at airplane cruise levels are sufficient to force re-routing of in-flight aircrafts. Volcanic fallout deposits spanning large distances have been recognized from the Somma-Vesuvius volcano for several Holocene explosive eruptions. Here we develop hazard and isochron maps for distal ash fallout from the Somma-Vesuvius, as well as hazard maps for critical ash concentrations at relevant flight levels. Maps are computed by coupling a meteorological model with a fully numeric tephra dispersal model that can account for ash aggregation processes, which are relevant to the dispersion dynamics of fine ash. The simulations were carried out using supercomputing facilities, spanning on entire meteorological year that is statistically representative of the local meteorology during the last few decades. Seasonal influences are also analyzed. The eruptive scenario is based on a Subplinian I-type eruption, which is within the range of the maximum expected event for this volcano. Results allow us to quantify the impact that an event of this magnitude and intensity would have on the main airports and aerial corridors of the Central Mediterranean Area.},

The RP is a mostly massive fall deposit with an inversely graded base. Empirical models suggest a maximum eruption column height H T of 30.5--35 km with an associated peak mass discharge rate of 2.8--4.8 {\texttimes} 108 kg/s. Analytical calculations result in H T values of 33 {\textpm} 4 km (inversion of TEPHRA2 model on grain size data) corresponding to mass discharge ranging from 2.3 to 6.0 {\texttimes} 108 kg/s. Lake-core data allow extrapolation of the deposit thinning trend far beyond onland exposures. Empirical fitting of thickness data yields volume estimates between 3.2 and 5.8 km3 (corresponding to an erupted mass of 1.1--2.0 {\texttimes} 1012 kg), whereas analytical derivation yields an erupted mass of 1.1 {\texttimes} 1012 kg (inversion of TEPHRA2 model). Modelling and dispersal maps are consistent with nearly no-wind conditions during the eruption. The plume corner is estimated to have been ca. 11--12 km from the vent. After an opening phase with gradually increasing intensity, a high discharge rate was maintained throughout the eruption, without fountain collapse as is evidenced by a lack of pyroclastic density current deposits.},

  abstract = {Hazard assessment of remote volcanic islands provides many challenges compared to other volcanoes and volcanic fields. Here we present the first systematic volcanic hazard assessment of Jan Mayen Island, a remote island located in the North-Atlantic Ocean and home to the northernmost active subaerial volcano in the world (Beerenberg Volcano), and we discuss some of the challenges and characteristics of performing a volcanic hazard assessment of a remote volcanic island. Jan Mayen has had at least five eruptions since its discovery at the start of the 17th century. Its Holocene volcanism is mainly characterized by eruptions with styles ranging from Hawaiian to Strombolian, but also by lava domes and Surtseyan eruptions. Based on field data, remote images, topographic data, past data, and computer simulations, our study evaluates the spatial probability of new vents opening, estimates eruption recurrence rates, simulates various eruption scenarios, and produces hazard maps for the different scenarios. This work shows where the hazards of ash fall, and lava flows are more likely to affect the built infrastructure on Jan Mayen Island. This hazard assessment will assist emergency planning and the determination of future land use on the island.},

The principal axis of tephra fall is to the NNE of Hekla and grain-size analysis reveals a systematic decrease in grain-size away from source. Majority of sample sites show typically unimodal grain-size distributions, although a few have bimodal distributions where the secondary mode is a subtle finer peak. The calculated total grain-size distribution (TGSD) is bimodal, with a coarse primary peak (-3.5 to -2.5 {$\varphi$}) and a subordinate fine peak (2.5 to 3.5 {$\varphi$}). The coarse peak is lapilli-dominated and was deposited within the first 25 km of transport, whereas the fine peak is coarse-ash-dominated and fits well with the modal grain-size of samples deposited {$>$}65 km from Hekla. Ascent rate of the magma and conditions for vesiculation in the shallow conduit became increasingly uniform with time through the 1991 opening phase.},

  abstract = {Assessing the damage to buildings from volcanic eruptions is an important aspect of volcanic risk assessment and management. However, there is a limited empirical evidence base to draw upon when describing the relation between volcanic hazard intensity and resulting physical damage. The 2015 subplinian eruption of Calbuco volcano, Chile, caused damage to buildings near the volcano because of tephra fall and lahars. Chilean authorities conducted a damage assessment of 961 properties (990 buildings) to inform an assistance programme for property owners affected by the eruption. Property assessments typically contained observations and classification of damage to a house, and in some instances accessory buildings such as sheds, garages, and exterior storage rooms. In this study we used this unique damage data set to adapt damage state frameworks for tephra fall and lahar for classifying and analysing damage observations. We developed data quality indicators to provide transparency for how we accounted for data quality issues. We assigned a tephra and/or lahar damage state to 571 buildings (530 houses and 41 accessory buildings). The 419 buildings for which we did not assign a damage state either had too little information or fell outside of tephra and/or lahar hazard zones. The minimum tephra thickness isopach band that caused complete collapse was 10 to 15 cm (dry deposit loading {\textasciitilde}1 to 1.6 kN m -2 , saturated deposit loading 1.6 to 2.4 kN m -2 ), but most commonly (55\% of tephra exposed DS5 houses n = 11), this occurred at 15 to 30 cm (dry deposit loading {\textasciitilde}1.5 to 3.3 kN m -2 , saturated deposit loading 2.4 to 4.8 kN m -2 ). Lahar damage was typically described as complete (DS5), with 26 houses being swept away or destroyed around the Blanco South River. Our results add to the limited evidence base of post-eruption tephra and lahar impacts to buildings and contribute to volcanic risk and impact assessment.},

  abstract = {Road networks in volcanically active regions can be exposed to various volcanic hazards from multiple volcanoes. Exposure assessments are often used in these environments to prioritise risk management and mitigation efforts towards volcanoes or hazards that present the greatest threat. Typically, road exposure has been assessed by quantifying the amount of road network affected by different hazards and/or hazard intensity. Whilst this approach is computationally efficient, it largely fails to consider the relative importance of road segments within the network (i.e., road criticality). However, road criticality is an important indicator of the disruption that may be caused by an eruption. In this work, we aim to integrate road criticality concepts to enhance typical volcanic eruption road exposure assessments into road disruption assessments. We use three key components to quantify disruption: a) road criticality, b) impact severity, and c) affected road quantity. Two case study eruptions: Merapi 2010 and Kelud 2014, both in Java, Indonesia, are used to demonstrate the usefulness of integrating road criticality into road disruption assessments from volcanic eruptions. We found that disruption of the road network from the Kelud 2014 case study was an order of magnitude greater than the Merapi 2010 case study. This is primarily driven by the more widely dispersed tephra fall from the Kelud 2014 event, which affected nearly 28\% of Java's road network length, compared to Merapi 2010, which affected 1.5\%. We also identified potential disruption hotspots that were affected by both of these case study eruptions. At Merapi, roads that carry traffic directly away from the summit, those that cross major valleys, and the major Yogyakarta-Magelang highway were key disruption hotspots, which has implications for moving large volumes of traffic efficiently, such as in an evacuation. The Kelud case study highlighted the potential impacts of widespread tephra falls on socio-economic activity and connectivity of large urban centres. Our approach has been designed such that it can be applied entirely using open-sourced datasets. Therefore, the approach to integrating road criticality in this paper can be used, applied, and adapted to assess road network disruption at any volcano in the world.},

  abstract = {The vesicularity of juvenile clasts in py\- roclastic deposits gives information on the rela\- tive timing of vesiculation and fragmentation, and on the role of magmatic volatiles versus externat water in driving explosive eruptions. The vesicu\- larity index and range are defined as the arith\- metic mean and total spread of vesicularity val\- ues, respectively. Clast densities are measured for the 16-32 mm size fraction by water immersion techniques and converted to vesicularities using measured dense-rock equivalent densities. The techniques used are applied to four case studies involving magmas of widely varying viscosities and discharge rates: Kilauea Iki 1959 (basait), Ei\- fel tuff rings (basanite), Mayor Island cone-form\- ing deposits (peralkaline rhyolite) and Taupo 1800 B.P. (calc-alkaline rhyolite). Previous theore\- tical studies suggested that a spectrum of clast ve\- sicularities should be seen, depending on the magma viscosity, eruption rate, and the presence and timing of magma:water interaction. The new data are consistent with these predictions. In mag\- matic "dry" eruptions the vesicularity index lies uniformly in the range 70\%-80\% regardless of magma viscosity. For high viscosities and erup\- tion rates the vesicularity ranges are narrow ( {$<$} 25\%), but broaden to between 30\% and 50\% as the viscosity and eruption rates are lowered and the volatiles and magma can de-couple. In phrea\- tomagmatic "wet" eruptions, widely varying clast vesicularities reflect complex variations in the re\- lative timing of vesiculation and water-induced fragmentation. Magma:water interaction at an early stage greatly reduces the vesicularity indices ( {$<$} 40\%) and broadens the ranges (as high as 80\%), whereas late-stage interaction has only a minor ef\- fect on the index and broadens the range to a lim- Offprint requests to: BF Houghton ited extent. Clast vesicularity represents a useful third parameter in addition to dispersal and frag\- mentation to characterise pyroclastic deposits.},

  abstract = {Proximal ({$<$}3 km) deposits from episodes II and III of the 60-h-long Novarupta 1912 eruption exhibit a very complex stratigraphy, the result of at least four transport regimes and diverse depositional mechanisms. They contrast with the relatively simple stratigraphy (and inferred emplacement mechanisms) for the previously documented, better known, medial--distal fall deposits and the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes ignimbrite. The proximal products include alternations and mixtures of both locally and regionally dispersed fall ejecta, and numerous thin complex deposits of pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) with no regional analogs. The locally dispersed component of the fall deposits forms sector-confined wedges of material whose thicknesses halve radially from and concentrically about the vent over distances of 100--300 m (cf. several kilometers for the medial--distal fall deposits). This locally dispersed fall material (and many of the associated PDC deposits) is rich in andesitic and banded pumices and richer in shallow-derived wall-rock lithics in comparison with the coeval medial fall units of almost entirely dacitic composition. There are no marked contrasts in grain size in the near-vent deposits, however, between locally and widely dispersed beds, and all samples of the proximal fall deposits plot as a simple continuation of grain size trends for medial--distal samples. Associated PDC deposits form a spectrum of facies from fines-poor, avalanched beds through thin-bedded, landscape-mantling beds to channelized lobes of pumice-block-rich ignimbrite. The origins of the Novarupta near-vent deposits are considered within a spectrum of four transport regimes: (1) sustained buoyant plume, (2) fountaining with co-current flow, (3) fountaining with counter-current flow, and (4) direct lateral ejection. The Novarupta deposits suggest a model where buoyant, stable, regime-1 plumes characterized most of episodes II and III, but were accompanied by transient and variable partitioning of clasts into the other three regimes. Only one short period of vent blockage and cessation of the Plinian plume occurred, separating episodes II and III, which was followed by a single PDC interpreted as an overpressured "blast" involving direct lateral ejection. In contrast, regimes 2 and 3 were reflected by spasmodic sedimentation from the margins of the jet and perhaps lower plume, which were being strongly affected by short-lived instabilities. These instabilities in turn are inferred to be associated with heterogeneities in the mixture of gas and pyroclasts emerging from the vent. Of the parameters that control explosive eruptive behavior, only such sudden and asymmetrical changes in the particle concentration could operate on time scales sufficiently short to explain the rapid changes in the proximal 1912 products.},

  abstract = {Auckland, New Zealand is unique in being a metropolitan area built on an active volcanic field. Despite the small size and intensity of Auckland eruptions, the risk from tephra fall is high because of the high density of buildings and lifelines. The nature of this threat can be evaluated by comparisons with historical Strombolian and Hawaiian eruptions, which have occurred in non-populated areas. Cone-building phases of such eruptions are typically protracted, i.e., weeks to months in duration, prolonging the period during which emergency managers will have to fine tune mitigation for numerous parameters such as fluctuations in intensity and wind shifts. Rapid cone growth during future eruptions will define a region of some 30 to 100 ha where complete destruction will occur on a time scale of hours. The cost of this destruction is likely to range between NZ\$200M and NZ\$1.4B (ca. US\$130M to US\$900M). Beyond this, we have modeled the cumulative long-term effect of the build-up of a downwind blanket of lapilli and ash by estimating accumulation rates for three phases of the 1959 K{\=i}lauea Iki eruption in Hawai'i. The effect of changing wind direction was evaluated using low-level wind data from Auckland. These results show that intervals between 4 and 100 h will lapse before onset of significant damage to buildings.},

  abstract = {Basaltic pyroclastic volcanism takes place over a range of scales and styles, from weak discrete Strombolian explosions (???102-103 kg s-1) to Plinian eruptions of moderate intensity (107-108 kg s-1). Recent well-documented historical eruptions from Etna, K??lauea and Stromboli typify this diversity. Etna is Europe's largest and most voluminously productive volcano with an extraordinary level and diversity of Strombolian to subplinian activity since 1990. K??lauea, the reference volcano for Hawaiian fountaining, has four recent eruptions with high fountaining ({$>$}400 m) activity in 1959, 1960, 1969 (-1974) and 1983-1986 (-2008); other summit (1971, 1974, 1982) and flank eruptions have been characterized by low fountaining activity. Stromboli is the type location for mildly explosive Strombolian eruptions, and from 1999 to 2008 these persisted at a rate of ca. 9 per hour, briefly interrupted in 2003 and 2007 by vigorous paroxysmal eruptions. Several properties of basaltic pyroclastic deposits described here, such as bed geometry, grain size, clast morphology and vesicularity, and crystal content are keys to understand the dynamics of the parent eruptions. The lack of clear correlations between eruption rate and style, as well as observed rapid fluctuations in eruptive behavior, point to the likelihood of eruption style being moderated by differences in the fluid dynamics of magma and gas ascent and the mechanism by which the erupting magma fragments. In all cases, the erupting magma consists of a mixture of melt and gaseous bubbles. The depth and rate of degassing, melt rheology, bubble rise and coalescence rates, and extent of syn-eruptive microlite growth define complex feedbacks that permit reversible shifts between fragmentation mechanisms and in eruption style and intensity. However, many basaltic explosive eruptions end after an irreversible shift to open-system outgassing and microlite crystallization in melt within the conduit. Clearer understanding of the factors promoting this diversity of basaltic pyroclastic eruptions is of fundamental importance in order to improve understanding of the range of behaviors of these volcanoes and assess hazards of future explosive events at basaltic volcanoes. The three volcanoes used for this review are the sites of large and growing volcano-tourism operations and there is a public need both for better knowledge of the volcanoes' behavior and improved forecasting of the likely course of future eruptions. ?? 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

We document here an event where neither magma nor an external water source was involved in explosive activity at K{\=i}lauea. Instead, the eruption was powered by the expansion of decoupled magmatic volatiles released from deeper magma, which was not ejected by the eruption, and the trigger was a collapse of near-surface wall rocks that then momentarily blocked that volatile flux. Mapping of the advected fall deposit a day after this eruption has highlighted the difficulty of constraining deposit edges from unobserved or prehistoric eruptions of all magnitudes. Our results suggest that the dispersal area of advected fall deposits could be miscalculated by up to 30\% of the total, raising issues for accurate hazard zoning and assessment. Eruptions of this type challenge existing classification schemes for pyroclastic deposits and explosive eruptions and, in the past, have probably been interpreted as phreatic explosions, where the eruptive mechanism has been assumed to involve flashing of groundwater to steam.},

  abstract = {Estimating the mass, volume, and dispersal of the deposits of very small and/or extremely weak explosive eruptions is diffi cult, unless they can be sampled on eruption. During explosive eruptions of Halema`uma`u Crater (K{\=i}lauea, Hawaii) in 2008, we constrained for the fi rst time deposits of bulk volumes as small as 9--300 m3 (1 {\texttimes} 104 to 8 {\texttimes} 105 kg) and can demonstrate that they show simple exponential thinning with distance from the vent. There is no simple fi t for such products within classifi cations such as the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI). The VEI is being increasingly used as the measure of magni- tude of explosive eruptions, and as an input for both hazard modeling and forecasting of atmospheric dispersal of tephra. The 2008 deposits demonstrate a problem for the use of the VEI, as originally defi ned, which classifi es small, yet ballistic-producing, explosive eruptions at K{\=i}lauea and other basaltic volcanoes as nonexplosive. We suggest a simple change to extend the scale in a fashion inclusive of such very small deposits, and to make the VEI more consistent with other mag- nitude scales such as the Richter scale for earthquakes. Eruptions of this magnitude constitute a signifi cant risk at K{\=i}lauea and elsewhere because of their high frequency and the growing number of ``volcano tourists'' visiting basaltic volcanoes.},

Blocks that were predominantly ballistically ejected were measured and sampled within an {\textasciitilde}2--3-km radius from vent and supply a picture of a dynamic and complex shallow conduit prior to magma fragmentation in repeated small explosions. Extreme conduit heterogeneity is expressed in the diverse range of dacitic block types, including pumiceous, dense, banded, and variably welded breccia clasts, all with varied degrees of surface breadcrusting. We present new maps of block lithology and size, making Episode IV the most thoroughly mapped Vulcanian deposit to date. Sectorial regions rich in specific lithologies together with the block size data suggest multiple, small explosions. Modeling of block trajectories to reproduce the field data indicates that ejection velocities range from 50 to 124 m/s with a median of {\textasciitilde}70 m/s. We propose that individual explosions originated from a heterogeneous shallow conduit characterized both by the juxtaposition of magma domains of contrasting texture and vesiculation state and by the intimate local mingling of different textures on short vertical and horizontal length scales at the contacts between these domains. In our model, each explosion disrupted the conduit to only shallow depths and tapped diverse, localized pockets within the conduit. This contrasts with existing models for repetitive Vulcanian explosions, and suggests that the dynamics of Episode IV were more complex than a simple progressive top-down evacuation of a horizontally stratified conduit.},

In the period 1970 to 2000, the frequency of such eruptions increased to once every decade. Hekla is currently inflated to above the levels observed prior to the most recent eruptions in 1991 and 2000. The next eruption could pose a hazard to air traffic between North America and Europe because explosive eruptions of Hekla, independent of size, typically start with a subplinian or Plinian phase that produces a sustained ash plume. We present an overview of five of the largest historical Hekla eruptions (taking place in 1104, 1158, 1300, 1693, and 1766). These eruptions cover a compositional range of rhyolite to andesite, previously estimated Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) values of 4--5 and are characterised by contrasting wind dispersal (dispersal axes NW--NE). New isopach maps show both greater deposit thicknesses in the proximal region and wider dispersal than previously inferred, resulting in different volume estimates (minimal values ranging between 0.18 and 0.91 km3). New isopleth maps were also compiled and resulted in inferred plume heights of about 13--25 km. These changes in the estimated values of volume and mass eruption rates have large implications on the forecasting and impacts of future Hekla eruptions.},

  abstract = {The large explosive eruption of Merapi volcano, Indonesia, in 2010 presented a key, and rare, opportunity to study the impacts of a major explosive eruption in a densely populated area. Pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) produced throughout the 2010 eruption were unusually destructive, causing near complete devastation across a 22km2swath of the densely populated southern flanks and casualties to the end of their runout at 15.5km from the volcano. The majority ({$>$}120) of the more than 200 fatalities occurred more than 12km from the volcano, where many people were caught in PDCs as they were evacuating. The 2010 eruption (VEI 4) exhibited a range of PDC behaviour in a complex multi-stage event that marked a change in eruption behaviour at Merapi, being the first eruption of this magnitude and style since 1872. This shift in style may mark a change in regime, and so understanding the potential impact of such large explosive eruptions is essential for future risk-assessment at Merapi. We describe a new impact assessment methodology that allowed us to collect important empirical geological, damage and casualty information and reconstruct impact dynamics associated with the PDCs. In contrast to previous PDC impact studies, we combined remote, field, laboratory and GIS assessments and were able to enter the affected areas safely and before their disturbance by rains or human activity. By integrating the results of our geological, damage and medical studies, we could reconstruct the spatial and temporal dynamics of the PDCs and their main hazard characteristics. Our interdisciplinary methods and preliminary findings are discussed here. In the areas damaged by PDCs, we used empirical damage data and calculations of material and structural resistance to lateral force to estimate approximate dynamic pressures. Dynamic pressures associated with the 5 November paroxysm exceeded 15kPa more than 6km from source and rapidly attenuated over a distance of less than 1km at the end of the PDC runouts. Analysis of thermal indicators, such as deformed plastic, and correlation with information on burns injuries and fires provided estimates of ambient temperatures associated with the PDCs. Even at the relatively low temperatures estimated for the PDCs (200-300{$^\circ$}C) they were lethal to people inside as well as outside buildings, in part because of the building design that enabled the PDCs to rapidly infiltrate inside. Such detailed quantitative data can be used to support numerical PDC and impact modelling and risk assessment at dome-forming volcanoes, providing an improved understanding of the complexity of PDCs and their associated impacts on exposed populations. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {This paper presents structured and cost-effective methods for assessing the physical vulnerability of at-risk communities to the range of volcanic hazards, developed as part of the MIA-VITA project (2009--2012). An initial assessment of building and infrastructure vulnerability has been carried out for a set of broadly defined building types and infrastructure categories, with the likelihood of damage considered separately for projectile impact, ash fall loading, pyroclastic density current dynamic pressure and earthquake ground shaking intensities. In refining these estimates for two case study areas: Kanlaon volcano in the Philippines and Fogo volcano in Cape Verde, we have developed guidelines and methodologies for carrying out physical vulnerability assessments in the field. These include identifying primary building characteristics, such as construction material and method, as well as subsidiary characteristics, for example the size and prevalence of openings, that may be important in assessing eruption impacts. At-risk buildings around Kanlaon were found to be dominated by timber frame buildings that exhibit a high vulnerability to pyroclastic density currents, but a low vulnerability to failure from seismic shaking. Around Fogo, the predominance of unreinforced masonry buildings with reinforced concrete slab roofs suggests a high vulnerability to volcanic earthquake but a low vulnerability to ash fall loading. Given the importance of agriculture for local livelihoods around Kanlaon and Fogo, we discuss the potential impact of infrastructure vulnerability for local agricultural economies, with implications for volcanic areas worldwide. These methodologies and tools go some way towards offering a standardised approach to carrying out future vulnerability assessments for populated volcanic areas.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Regional volcanic threat assessments provide a large-scale comparable vision of the threat posed by multiple volcanoes. They are useful for prioritising risk-mitigation actions and are required by local through international agencies, industries and governments to prioritise where further study and support could be focussed. Most regional volcanic threat studies have oversimplified volcanic hazards and their associated impacts by relying on concentric radii as proxies for hazard footprints and by focussing only on population exposure. We have developed and applied a new approach that quantifies and ranks exposure to multiple volcanic hazards for 40~high-threat volcanoes in Southeast Asia. For each of our 40~volcanoes, hazard spatial extent, and intensity where appropriate, was probabilistically modelled for four volcanic hazards across three eruption scenarios, giving 697\,080~individual hazard footprints plus 15\,240~probabilistic hazard outputs. These outputs were overlain with open-access datasets across five exposure categories using an open-source Python geographic information system~(GIS) framework developed for this study (https://github.com/vharg/VolcGIS, last access: 5~April~2022). All study outputs -- more than 6500~GeoTIFF files and 70~independent estimates of exposure to volcanic hazards across 40~volcanoes -- are provided in the ``Data availability'' section in user-friendly format. Calculated exposure values were used to rank each of the 40 volcanoes in terms of the threat they pose to surrounding communities. Results highlight that the island of Java in Indonesia has the highest median exposure to volcanic hazards, with Merapi consistently ranking as the highest-threat volcano. Hazard seasonality, as a result of varying wind conditions affecting tephra dispersal, leads to increased exposure values during the peak rainy season (January, February) in Java but the dry season (January through April) in the Philippines. A key aim of our study was to highlight volcanoes that may have been overlooked perhaps because they have not been frequently or recently active but that have the potential to affect large numbers of people and assets. It is not intended to replace official hazard and risk information provided by the individual country or volcano organisations. Rather, this study and the tools developed provide a road map for future multi-source regional volcanic exposure assessments with the possibility to extend the assessment to other geographic regions and/or towards impact and loss.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the hazard posed by Volcanic Ballistic Projectiles (VBPs) to the Santorini islands considering eruption scenarios that include low (VEI=2--3) and higher energy (VEI {$>$}3) eruptions. A model that describes rapid decompression of pressurized magma below a caprock along with its fragmentation and acceleration of particles is utilized for estimating initial velocities during vulcanian-style eruptions. These initial velocities are inserted into the ballistic equations assuming that VBPs have a cube-like shape, are subjected to gravity/drag forces and are launched into a zone of reduced drag. Four different diameters of VBPs are considered (0.35m, 1.0m, 2.0m, 3.0m) and also different values of gas fractions and extent of the reduced drag zone are investigated. The results of these calculations show that an area of 1--2km width along the western coast of Thera will be within the maximum range of VBPs, provided that the eruptive vent will develop either on Nea Kameni or between Nea Kameni and Thera. Initial velocities for higher energy eruptions are estimated by considering the conversion efficiency of thermal to kinetic energy. For the case of an eruption with VEI=4 and a number of vents centered between Nea and Palea Kameni, calculations show that the coastal areas of Thera and Therasia are within the maximum horizontal range of VBPs with diameter larger than 0.35m. As the exact position of the eruptive vent seems to be of crucial importance for determining the areas at risk, continuous seismic and geodetic monitoring of the caldera is needed in order to decipher its likely location.},

  abstract = {Learning incorporates a broad range of complex procedures. Machine learning (ML) is a subdivision of artificial intelligence based on the biological learning process. The ML approach deals with the design of algorithms to learn from machine readable data. ML covers main domains such as data mining, difficult-to-program applications, and software applications. It is a collection of a variety of algorithms (e.g. neural networks, support vector machines, self-organizing map, decision trees, random forests, case-based reasoning, genetic programming, etc.) that can provide multivariate, nonlinear, nonparametric regression or classification. The modeling capabilities of the ML-based methods have resulted in their extensive applications in science and engineering. Herein, the role of ML as an effective approach for solving problems in geosciences and remote sensing will be highlighted. The unique features of some of the ML techniques will be outlined with a specific attention to genetic programming paradigm. Furthermore, nonparametric regression and classification illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of ML for tackling the geosciences and remote sensing problems.},

  abstract = {Repeated ash fall events have occurred during the 1999-ongoing eruption of Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador, notably during the late 1999 and August 2001 eruptive phases. While the eruptive styles were similar, these two phases had different impacts on nearby rural and urban Andean populations: ash falls in late 1999 had limited effects on human health and farming, whereas the 2001 phase resulted in medical problems, death of animals in livestock, and damages to houses and crops. Here we investigate the origin of this difference by estimating the size of the August 2001 event (VEI, magnitude, intensity), and by comparing monitoring information of the 1999 and 2001 phases (duration, explosion rate, column height, SO2 output rate). The results show that both phases ranked at VEI 3, although the longer 1999 phase was likely larger than the 2001 phase. Mass magnitude (M) and intensity (I) indexes calculated for the 2001 phase reach M{$\approx$}2.7 and I{$\approx$}6.5 when based on ash fall layer data, but increase to M{$\approx$}3.2 and I{$\approx$}7.0 when ballistic products are included. We investigated the influence of rain fall and wind flow regimes on ash dispersion, sedimentation and remobilization. The analysis indicates that the harmful effect of the 2001 phase resulted from unfavorable conditions that combined volcanological and seasonal origins, including: a) a low elevation of the ash plume above rural regions owed to a usually bent-over column, b) ash sedimentation in a narrow area west of the volcano under sub-steady wind directions, c) anticipated ash settling by frequent rain flushing of low intensity, and d) formation of a wet cohesive ash coating on buildings and harvests. Conversely, the stronger 1999 phase injected a large amount of ash at higher elevation in the dry season; the ash was widely disseminated across the whole Ecuadorian territory and beyond, and was frequently removed by rain and winds. In summary, our study illustrates the influences of eruption size and weather conditions on the impact of volcanic activity in a tropical setting and puts emphasis on the necessity to merge volcanological and meteorological monitoring duties for hazard assessment and alert level definition, in order to mitigate the effect of ash falls in the Andes and elsewhere.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Ashfall from volcanic eruptions endangers crop production and food security while jeopardising agricultural livelihoods. As populations in the vicinity of volcanoes continue to grow, strategies to reduce volcanic risks to and impacts on crops are increasingly needed. Current models of crop vulnerability to ash are limited. They also rely solely on ash thickness (or loading) as the hazard intensity metric and fail to reproduce the complex interplay of other volcanic and non-volcanic factors that drive impact. Amongst these, ash retention on crop leaves affects photosynthesis and is ultimately responsible for widespread damage to crops. In this context, we carried out greenhouse experiments to assess how ash grain size, leaf pubescence, and humidity conditions at leaf surfaces influence the retention of ash (defined as the percentage of foliar cover coated with ash) in tomato and chilli pepper plants, two crop types commonly grown in volcanic regions. For a fixed ash mass load ({$\sim$}570\,g\,m-2), we found that ash retention decreases exponentially with increasing grain size and is enhanced when leaves are pubescent (such as in tomato plants) or when their surfaces are wet. Assuming that leaf area index (LAI) diminishes with ash retention in tomato and chilli pepper plants, we derived a new expression for predicting potential crop yield loss after an ashfall event. We suggest that the measurement of crop LAI in ash-affected areas may serve as an impact metric. Our study demonstrates that quantitative insights into crop vulnerability can be gained rapidly from controlled experiments. We advocate this approach to broaden our understanding of ash--plant interactions and to validate the use of remote sensing methods for assessing crop damage and recovery at various spatial and time scales after an eruption.},

At present, a wide variety of qualitative or semi-quantitative strategies is adopted, and there is not yet a commonly accepted quantitative and general strategy. Pre-eruptive processes are extremely complicated, with many degrees of freedom nonlinearly coupled, and poorly known, so scientists must quantify eruption forecasts through the use of probabilities. On the other hand, this also forces decision-makers to make decisions under uncertainty. We review the present state of the art in this field in order to identify the main gaps of the existing procedures. Then, we put forward a general quantitative procedure that may overcome the present barriers, providing guidelines on how probabilities may be used to take rational mitigation actions. These procedures constitute a crucial link between science and society; they can be used to establish objective and transparent decision-making protocols and also clarify the role and responsibility of each partner involved in managing a crisis.},

A range of pyroclast sizes between 16 and 32 mm has commonly been chosen for this purpose. Larger pyroclasts outside this range may undergo postfragmentation vesiculation due to slow cooling of the interior of the clasts, while smaller pyroclasts may be too small to represent accurately the distribution of the largest vesicles. The assumption of this method, of course, is that the 16--32 mm size range is representative of the fragmented magma. We explore, in detail, variations in density over a size range of 4--128 mm from Unit 2 pyroclasts of the 1.8 ka Taupo eruption and make inferences about the roles of postfragmentation vesiculation and secondary breakage of pyroclasts. We find (1) there is a clear threshold for onset of postfragmentation vesiculation at \&gt;32 mm, and (2) there are broken small pieces of the largest pyroclasts in the sample that artificially skew the density distribution for smaller size fractions. We constrain uncertainty associated with vesicularity measurements and offer best-practice recommendations in the hope of improving consistency of field sampling and laboratory processing of pyroclast populations for vesicularity studies.},

Highlights include: (1) Construction of an Old Merapi stratovolcano to the height of the present cone or slightly higher. Our oldest age for an explosive eruption is 9630 {\textpm} 6014C y B.P.; construction of Old Merapi certainly began earlier. (2) Collapse(s) of Old Merapi that left a somma rim high on its eastern slope and sent one or more debris avalanche(s) down its southern and western flanks. Impoundment of Kali Progo to form an early Lake Borobudur at {$\sim$}340014C y B.P. hints at a possible early collapse of Merapi. The latest somma-forming collapse occurred {$\sim$}190014C y B.P. The current cone, New Merapi, began to grow soon thereafter. (3) Several large and many small Buddhist and Hindu temples were constructed in Central Java between 732 and {$\sim$}900 A.D. (roughly, 1400-100014C y B.P.). Explosive Merapi eruptions occurred before, during and after temple construction. Some temples were destroyed and (or) buried soon after their construction, and we suspect that this destruction contributed to an abrupt shift of power and organized society to East Java in 928 A.D. Other temples sites, though, were occupied by "caretakers" for several centuries longer. (4) A partial collapse of New Merapi occurred {$<$}1130 {\textpm} 5014C y B.P. Eruptions {$\sim$}700-80014C y B.P. (12-14th century A.D.) deposited ash on the floors of (still-occupied?) Candi Sambisari and Candi Kedulan. We speculate but cannot prove that these eruptions were triggered by (the same?) partial collapse of New Merapi, and that the eruptions, in turn, ended "caretaker" occupation at Candi Sambisari and Candi Kedulan. A new or raised Lake Borobudur also existed during part or all of the 12-14th centuries, probably impounded by deposits from Merapi. (5) Relatively benign lava-dome extrusion and dome-collapse pyroclastic flows have dominated activity of the 20th century, but explosive eruptions much larger than any of this century have occurred many times during Merapi's history, most recently during the 19th century. Are the relatively small eruptions of the 20th century a new style of open-vent, less hazardous activity that will persist for the foreseeable future? Or, alternatively, are they merely low-level "background" activity that could be interrupted upon relatively short notice by much larger explosive eruptions? The geologic record suggests the latter, which would place several hundred thousand people at risk. We know of no reliable method to forecast when an explosive eruption will interrupt the present interval of low-level activity. This conclusion has important implications for hazard evaluation. {\copyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Group discussion followed by formal expert elicitation is an excellent way to estimate probabilities at each branch of a tree, but commonly neither sufficient time exists nor a large group of experts is available for a new formal elicitation. This chapter describes a simpler, easily understandable method that can be used in advance of more formal elicitations. This "method of multiple data sets" intentionally uses a number of different data sets at each node. At some nodes, quite different types of data are used, e.g., seismic, gas, and dates of historical eruptions. At other nodes, data sets differ only in the time periods or subsets of volcanoes that are considered. The goal is to define a robust range of plausible probabilities at each branch. The best estimate is probably within this range, and the spread between high and the low values is a rough indication of the uncertainty. We offer a generic Excel-based template that can be modified by any user as needed, case histories of several applications in past crises, and ideas for future improvements and uses of event trees.},

  abstract = {Metal roofing material is commonly used for residential and industrial roofs in volcanically active areas. Increased corrosion of metal roofing from chemically reactive volcanic ash following ash deposition post-eruption is a major concern due to decreasing the function and stability of roofs. Currently, assessment of ash-induced corrosion is anecdotal, and quantitative data are lacking. Here, we systematically evaluate the corrosive effects of volcanic ash, specifically ash leachates, on a variety of metal roofing materials (i.e. weathered steel, zinc, galvanized steel, and Colorsteel{\copyright}) utilizing weathering chamber experiments and direct acid treatments. Weathering chamber tests were carried out for up to 30 days, and visual, chemical, and surface analyses did not definitively identify significant corrosion in any of the test roofing metal samples. Direct concentrated acid treatments with hydrochloric (HCl), sulphuric (H2SO4), and hydrofluoric (HF) acids demonstrate that roofing materials are chemically resilient. Our experimental results suggest that ash-leachate-related corrosion is a longer-term process ({$>$}1 month), potentially related to a multitude of factors including increased ash leachate concentrations, the dissolution of the glass matrix of the ash, moisture retention at the ash-surface boundary, and potential reactions involving photo-oxidation. Overall, corrosion is not a simple process related to the short-term release of acid and/or salt leachates from the ash surface, but a product of dynamic interactions involving ash and water at the surface of metal roofing material for extended periods.},

  abstract = {Tephra falls of varying character and volume occurred between April 2 and early September 1991, from eruptions of Mount Pinatubo. From April 2 to June 12, first phreatic explosions and later ash emissions related to emplacement of a lava dome produced mostly thin and fine-grained deposits over several hundred square kilometers west and south of the vent. A brief explosive eruption on the morning of June 12 deposited about 0.014 cubic kilometers of andes- itic scoria. ash, and accidental lithic fragments southwest of the volcano (layer A). Several similar events over the next 2 days, followed by numerous pyroclastic-surge-producing explosions between the afternoon ofJune 14 and early after- noon of June 15, emplaced a 0.2-cubic-kilometer, lami- nated, mostly fine-grained ash-fall deposit (layer B) over broad areas around the volcano. The wide dispersal of layer B was induced by ash clouds convecting upward from pyro- clastic surges that moved radially outward about l0 kilome- ters from the vent and the onset of low-altitude northerly to westerly winds as a tropical storm approached the area' The most voluminous deposit of the 1991 eruption sequence is a dacitic pumice-fall deposit (layer C) that was produced by the climactic eruption during the afternoon of June 15' A densely settled area of about 2,000 square kilometers was blanketed by 10 to 25 centimeters of rain-soaked tephra; 189 people were killed by collapsing buildings, and damage to uiitities and agricultural lands was extensive' Most of Luzon and a roughly 4-million-square-kilometer area of the South China Sea and Southeast Asia were affected by tephra fall. The bulk volume of layer C probably lies between 3'4 and 4.4 cubic kilometers, ranking it among the five largest of the 20th century. The climactic eruption also produced voluminous pyroclastic-flow deposits and a 2.5-kilometer- diameter caldera. Slowly diminishing ash emissions contin- ued from several vents in the caldera for about 6 weeks following the climactic eruption and produced a fine-grained laminated tephra deposit (layer D), which has a bulk volume of about 0.2 cubic kilometer. Grain-size analyses of samples of layer C display well- known features of plinian tephra-fall deposits as distance from the vent increases, including decrease in median grain size, decrease in maximum pumice size, and improvement in sorting. Component analyses show that pumice domi- nates in grain-size fractions coarser than I millimeter, whereas crystals dominate in finer fractions. Lithic frag- ments make up a few percent or less of each fraction. Deposits of layer C typically have normal grading' which suggests that eruption intensity peaked early and then decreased until ending prior to cessation of pyroclastic-flow activity. Various lines of evidence imply that peak activity of the climactic eruption was sustained for approximately 3 hours, and a waning level ofactivity continued for 6 hours more.},

Near-real-time interpretation of images derived from the amplitude of the SAR signals and timely delivery of these interpretations to those responsible for warnings, allowed satellite remote sensing for the first time to play an equal role with in situ seismic, geodetic and gas monitoring in guiding life-saving decisions during a major volcanic crisis. Our remotely sensed data provide an observational chronology for the main phase of the 2010 eruption, which lasted 12days (26 October-7 November, 2010). Unlike the prolonged low-rate and relatively low explosivity dome-forming and collapse eruptions of recent decades at Merapi, the eruption began with an explosive eruption that produced a new summit crater on 26 October and was accompanied by an ash column and pyroclastic flows that extended 8km down the flanks. This initial explosive event was followed by smaller explosive eruptions on 29 October-1 November, then by a period of rapid dome growth on 1-4 November, which produced a summit lava dome with a volume of {\textasciitilde}5{\texttimes}106m3. A paroxysmal VEI 4 magmatic eruption (with ash column to 17km altitude) destroyed this dome, greatly enlarged the new summit crater and produced extensive pyroclastic flows (to {\textasciitilde}16km radial distance in the Gendol drainage) and surges during the night of 4-5 November. The paroxysmal eruption was followed by a period of jetting of gas and tephra and by a second short period (12h) of rapid dome growth on 6 November. The eruption ended with low-level ash and steam emissions that buried the 6 November dome with tephra and continued at low levels until seismicity decreased to background levels by about 23 November. Our near-real-time commercial SAR documented the explosive events on 26 October and 4-5 November and high rates of dome growth ({$>$}25m3s-1). An event tree analysis for the previous 2006 Merapi eruption indicated that for lava dome extrusion rates {$>$}1.2m3s-1, the probability of a large (1872-scale) eruption was {\textasciitilde}10\%. Consequently, the order-of-magnitude greater rates in 2010, along with the explosive start of the eruption on 26 October, the large volume of lava accumulating at the summit by 4 November, and the rapid and large increases in seismic energy release, deformation and gas emissions were the basis for warnings of an unusually large eruption by the Indonesian Geological Agency's Center for Volcanology and Geologic Hazard Mitigation (CVGHM) and their Volcano Research and Technology Development Center (BPPTK) in Yogyakarta - warnings that saved thousands of lives. {\copyright} 2012.},

  abstract = {An improved empirical method for the plotting of field data and the calculation of tephra fall volumes is presented. The widely used "area" plots of ln(thickness) against ln(isopach area) are curved, implying an exponential thinning law. Use of ln(thickness)-(area) 1/2 diagrams confirm the exponential dependence of many parameters (e. g. thickness, maximum and median clast size) with distance from source, producing linear graphs and allowing volumes to be calculated without undue extrapolation of field data. The agreement between theoretical models of clast dispersion and observation is better than previously thought. Two new quantitative parameters are proposed which describe the rates of thinning of the deposit (bt the thickness half-distance) and the maximum clast size (be the clast half-distance). Many deposits exhibit different grainsize and thickness thinning rates, with the maximum clast size diminishing 1-3 times slower than the thickness. This implies that the entrained grainsize population influences the morphologic and granulometric patterns of the resulting deposit, in addition to the effects of column height and windspeed. The grainsize characteristics of a deposit are best described by reference to the half-distance ratio (bJbt). A new classification scheme is proposed which plots the half-distance ratio against the thickness half-distance and may be contoured in terms of the column height.},

We present strategies for: (1) the selection of appropriate cost functions accounting for their behaviour and implied distribution of residuals, (2) the treatment of differential uncertainty when combining multiple data, and (3) the leveraging of both model and data when estimating the spatial distribution of output. Results show that a data-informed choice of cost function and accounting for uncertainty and spatial characteristics of data leads to consistent improvements in model predictive performance for both inversion and forward models.},

The April-May 2015 Calbuco eruption in Chile involved eruption and resuspension activities. We overview the chronology, effects, and products resulting from these events, in order to validate an operational forecast strategy for tephra dispersal. The modelling strategy builds on coupling the meteorological Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF/ARW) model with the FALL3D dispersal model for eruptive and resuspension processes. The eruption modelling considers two distinct particle granulometries, a preliminary first guess distribution used operationally when no field data was available yet, and a refined distribution based on field measurements. Volcanological inputs were inferred from eruption reports and results from an Argentina-Chilean ash sample data network, which performed in-situ sampling during the eruption. In order to validate the modelling strategy, results were compared with satellite retrievals and ground deposit measurements. Results indicate that the WRF-FALL3D modelling system can provide reasonable forecasts in both eruption and resuspension modes, particularly when the adjusted granulometry is considered. The study also highlights the importance of having dedicated datasets of active volcanoes furnishing first-guess model inputs during the early stages of an eruption.},

This consensus effort across multiple research teams was coordinated by the Instituto Volcanol{\'o}gico de Canarias (INVOLCAN). Teams were deployed strategically to compile comprehensive tephra stratigraphy through field mapping (depending on plume direction records and real-time tephra-fall observations). Tephra production was nearly continuous during the eruption, and the resulting stratigraphic framework, chronology, and distribution form a robust link between temporally resolved observations of eruption style, plume dynamics, changing chemistry of volcanic products, and geophysical records registered during this highly accessible yet destructive eruption. This article is focused on the scientific coordination effort and on the value that collaborative data streams had during the crisis (for the volcano emergency response teams), as well as on the processes that contributed to the creation of these successful and multidisciplinary data sets.},

Viscosity can be quantified by the limited settling of olivine phenocrysts and rate of flow by field observations related to the low-angle slope on which the lava flowed. Much can be learned about the viscosity, rheologic condition, and flow velocity of lavas long after solidification by analyses of their structural characteristics, and it is possible to make at least a semiquantitative assessment of the numerical values of these parameters.},

  abstract = {Tephra fallout represented a major source of hazard for eastern Sicily during the 2001 eruption of Mt. Etna (Italy) between 19 July and 6 August. Long-lasting explosive activity was generated from the 2570 m vent, producing a volcanic plume up to 5 km high above sea level. The eruption caused copious lapilli and ash fallout over the volcano flanks for several days. Flight operations were cancelled at the Catania and Reggio Calabria airports; health risk and economic damage put communities living close to this active volcano on the alert. The explosive activity at the 2570 m vent had three main phases characterized by phreatomagmatic, magmatic and vulcanian explosions. In this paper, we analyze the first explosive phase between 19 and 24 July that formed a tephra deposit on the volcano's south-east flanks. Immediately after the first phase of the eruption, numerous tephra samples were collected in order to draw an isomass map, calculate physical parameters for the eruption and analyze the plume dispersion on the basis of deposit geometry. The tephra deposit shows a bilobate shape due to the change with time of both the vigour of the eruption and the wind direction and velocity that caused a higher rate of particle accumulation along two dispersal axes (SE and SSE). The total mass of tephra erupted was calculated with two different fitting methods: exponential line segments and a power law fit on the semi-logarithmic plot of mass per unit area versus area, resulting in values of 1.02â109 kg and 2.31â109 kg, respectively. The whole deposit grain-size was calculated applying the Voronoi tessellation method, it shows a mode of 2{$\phi$} and thus indicates a high degree of magma fragmentation during the first phase of the eruption. Plume dispersal was investigated by an advection--diffusion model to reconstruct the tephra deposit. In the modelling, we took into account the variations of wind direction and velocity, and eruption intensity by dividing the explosive phase into sixteen sub-eruptions and considering the final deposit as the sum of the mass computed for each sub-eruption. Using best fit procedures, we find that the optimal agreement between computed values and field data is obtained by using the total mass calculated with the power law fit and a terminal settling velocity distribution with a particle aggregation model. The computed tephra dispersal was able to reproduce the bilobate shape of the real deposit. This work proves that advection--diffusion models can describe sedimentation processes of weak, i.e., bent-over, long-lasting plumes if the variations of wind direction and velocity, and eruptive intensity are included.},

  abstract = {We have recognized a type of pyroclastic deposit formed by the interaction of water and silicic magma during explosive eruptions. These deposits have a widespread dispersal, similar to plinian tephra, but the overall grain size is much tiner. Several deposits studied can be associated with caldera lakes or sea water and water/magma interaction is proposed to account for the fine grain size. Several examples have been studied, including the Oruanui Formation, N.Z., and the Askja 1875 deposit. Both show little downwind decrease in median diameter, a downwind decrease in sorting ({$\sigma\varphi$}) (more evident in the Askja deposit) and coarse tail grading. The Askja example has base surge deposits near source and some Oruanui members show multiple thin beds near source; both are common features of phreatomagmatic deposits. Isopachs of the Askja deposit indicate a source under Lake Oskjuvatn in Askja Caldera and those of the Oruanui indicate a source under the NW part of Lake Taupo. In terms of dispersal area, volume and calculated eruption column heights, these deposits are similar to plinian. However, their extreme fragmentation due to magma/water interaction, superimposed on fragmentation imparted by carlier vesiculation, gives a much finer and more complex grain size distribution than plinian counterparts. The field of phreatomagmatic equivalents to plinian pumice deposits was unoccupied on Walker's (1973) classification of explosive volcanic eruptions. Such deposits are the phreatomagmatic analogue of plinian deposits and the name << phreatoplinian >> is proposed. {\copyright} 1978 Intern.

  abstract = {Vulcano is one of the 7 volcanic islands and 6 seamounts forming the Aeolian volcanic district (Italy). Vulcano has a long eruptive record, and its last eruption (1888--90 AD) originated the definition of the Vulcanian eruptive style. Like most volcanic islands, Vulcano generates many potentially interconnected hazards, determining a potentially high risk. Here, we review the state of knowledge on its geology, eruptive activity, historical accounts, structural setting, geophysical and geochemical surveillance, and available hazard assessment, in order to have an updated picture of the state knowledge on volcanic hazard. We follow a prototypal reviewing scheme, based on three standardized steps: i) review of the volcanic system; ii) review of available eruptive and non-eruptive hazard quantifications; iii) development of a conceptual interpretative model. We find that, while a rather vast literature is dedicated to the volcanic system of Vulcano and the reconstruction of past events, few quantitative hazard assessments exist. In addition, the range of natural variability considered for each hazard is potentially underestimated (e.g. limited range of considered eruption magnitude and style and of vent position), as it is the potential effect of multi-hazard impact. The developed conceptual model for the feeding system provides a synthetic picture of the present knowledge about the system, as emerged from the review. In addition, it allows for the identification of potential paths-to-eruption and provides a first order link among the main hazards. This review provides an up-to-date snapshot of existing knowledge on volcanic hazard at Vulcano on which to build future hazard quantifications as well as to support present and future decision making.},

  abstract = {Subaerial pyroclastic deposits are of three genetic types: (1) fall, (2) surge, and (3) flow. Although pyroclastic flows include a wide range of volume magnitudes, only small-scale eruptions have been observed. Flows are composed of a dense, basal avalanche and an overriding cloud of entrained particles that rise by convective buoyancy. Theoretical models explain the generation of pyroclastic flows by gravitational collapse of an eruption column. The high apparent mobility of pyroclastic flows is largely due to the dissipation of kinetic and potential energy imparted at the time of eruption. The regular stratigraphic succession of fall, surge, and flow deposits is compatible with a column-collapse model. The textures, morphology, and distribution of pyroclastic flow deposits suggest emplacement as thick, dense beds that may be quasi-fluidized near their source, but which flow mainly in a laminar mode toward their distal reaches. Smaller flows may move entirely as single laminar beds. Large primary deposits may show a facies change controlled by the gradation from an inflated proximal stage into a deflated distal stage. Some deposits may undergo secondary (or tertiary) flowage following welding to produce textures and structures similar to lava flows. The various degrees of welding and secondary crystallization are principally controlled by emplacement temperature, thickness, and composition.},

  abstract = {Pyroclastic flows clearly present a serious threat to life for the inhabitants of settlements on the slopes of volcanoes with a history of explosive eruptions; but it is increasingly realised that buildings can provide a measure of protection to occupants trapped by such flows. One important example is Vesuvius, whose eruption history includes many events which were lethal for the inhabitants of the neighbouring Vesuvian villages. Recent computational fluid dynamics computer modelling for Vesuvius [Todesco et al., Bull. Volcanol. 64 (2002) 155--177] has enabled a realistic picture of an explosive eruption to be modelled, tracing the time-dependent development of the physical parameters of a simulated flow at a large three-dimensional mesh of points, based on assumed conditions of temperature, mass-flow rate and particle size distribution at the vent. The output includes mapping of temperature, mixture density and mixture velocity over the whole adjacent terrain. But to date this information has not been used to assess the impacts of such flows on buildings and their occupants. In the project reported in this paper, estimates of the near-ground flow parameters were used to assess the impact of a particular simulated pyroclastic flow (modelled roughly on the 1631 eruption) on the buildings and population in four of the Vesuvian villages considered most at risk. The study had five components. First, a survey of buildings and the urban environment was conducted to identify the incidence of characteristics and elements likely to affect human vulnerability, and to classify the building stock. The survey emphasised particularly the number, location and type of openings characteristic of the major classes of the local building stock. In the second part of the study, this survey formed the basis for estimates of the probable impact of the pyroclastic flow on the envelope and internal air conditions of typical buildings. In the third part, a number of distinct ways in which human casualties would occur were identified, and estimates were made of the relationship between casualty rates and environmental conditions for each casualty type. In the fourth part of the study, the assumed casualty rates were used to estimate the proportions of occupants who would be killed or seriously injured for the assumed pyroclastic flow scenario in the Vesuvian villages studied, and their distribution by distance from the vent. It was estimated that in a daytime eruption, 25 min after the start of the eruption, there would be 480 deaths and a further 190 serious injuries, for every 1000 remaining in the area. In a night-time scenario, there would be 360 deaths with a further 230 serious injuries per 1000 after the same time interval. Finally, a set of risk factors for casualties was identified, and factors were discussed and ranked for their mitigation impact in the eruption scenario. The most effective mitigation action would of course be total evacuation before the start of the eruption. But if this were not achieved, barred window openings or sealed openings to slow the ingress of hot gases, together with a reduction of the fire load, could be effective means of reducing casualty levels.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the development and application of an impact model for a future hypothetical sub-Plinian eruption of La Soufri{\`e}re of Guadeloupe. The model was designed to assess the impact from either a single or multiple eruption scenarios, each defined in terms of a map of the intensity of three volcanic hazards; volcanogenic earthquake, tephra fallout and pyroclastic density currents. The impact from the three hazards can be assessed independently or alternatively the joint impact of the three hazards can be assessed. The outputs that are produced from the model are; the number of buildings with collapsed roofs, and the number of fatal and non-fatal casualties. Two versions of the impact model were developed, one that uses a spreadsheet and another that is implemented using a Geographical Information System (GIS). Both versions use the same types of hazard inputs and vulnerability functions to derive the number of building collapses and casualties, but have different spatial resolution of the final outputs. The spreadsheet version aggregates the results at a zone level defined specifically for this project whereas the GIS was designed to produce results using 250~m grid-squares. The outputs from the two versions, when using the same eruption scenario, produced somewhat different results, highlighting the importance of defining the appropriate spatial resolution. The vulnerability functions were developed using data on the building stock that was collected by a local survey, in which data on the form of construction, condition, location and types of openings and the variation of these parameters across the affected area were collected. The vulnerability functions incorporated new assessments of fire risks induced by pyroclastic density currents. The model was applied to La Soufri{\`e}re using a range of input hazard scenarios based on reconstruction of the most recent sub-Plinian magmatic eruption which occurred in 1530~AD. A sensitivity analysis of the model was carried out choosing the inputs from a range of defined input values. The effect on losses and casualties of a range of possible mitigation measures was assessed by running the original model and the modified model using the same input eruption scenario. A separate casualty treatment model was also developed and tested.},

In all case studies, the higher probability flow directions identified using FlowDIR agreed with the travel direction of historically observed flows. Given its intuitive outputs and rapid execution time, FlowDIR can be used to supplement existing modelling strategies for hazard assessment of topographically controlled hazardous flows prior to and during crisis. We demonstrate this by coupling FlowDIR output probabilities with an empirical hazard model to estimate probability of block-and-ash flow inundation at Gede volcano, Indonesia.},

  abstract = {Quantitatively assessing long-term volcanic risk can be challenging due to the many variables associated with volcanic hazard and vulnerability. This study presents a structured first-order approach for considering variables in hazard and vulnerability analyses, such as eruption style and cyclic fragility, in order to quantitatively estimate risk. Probabilistic volcanic hazard data derived from advection--diffusion--sedimentation tephra fall model TEPHRA2 and probabilistic volcanic hazard analysis tool BET\_VH (Bayesian Event Tree for Volcanic Hazards) are combined with fragility functions and seasonal vulnerability coefficients for agricultural production to calculate volcanic risk indices which represent the likelihood of damage or loss to farm production over a given time frame. The resulting dataset allows for approximations of quantitative risk over a continuous range of ash thickness thresholds, at multiple levels of uncertainty, and in the context of fluctuating hazard and vulnerability environments (e.g., seasonal wind patterns and crop phases). We illustrate this approach through a case study which evaluates the risk of incurring 90\% damage to agricultural production at dairy and fruit farms in the Bay of Plenty region of New Zealand (BoP) due to ashfall from a Plinian eruption phase at the large local caldera volcano, the Okataina Volcanic Centre (OVC). Consideration of seasonal wind profiles, seasonal fluctuations in fruit and dairy farm vulnerability, multiple possible OVC eruption styles, different possible OVC vent locations, and a continuous distribution of ash thickness and damage thresholds enables a multi-dimensional analysis that aims to reflect the natural complexity and interdependencies associated with volcanic risk. A risk uncertainty matrix is introduced as a conceptual scheme to help guide evaluation and communication of the results of such quantitative risk analyses by showing how different types of uncertainty can yield ``maximum'', ``average'', or ``minimum'' estimates of risk. Results of this case study indicate that BoP fruit farms are at higher risk of experiencing damage and production loss from OVC ashfall than dairy farms, and farms to the east of the OVC are typically at higher risk than farms to the north of the OVC. Forecasts based on the annual maximum estimate of risk for fruit farms show a regional average of 2.3\% probability (greater than 1 in 50 likelihood) of experiencing 90\% damage from a basaltic or rhyolitic Plinian eruption from anywhere within the OVC over a period of 100 years. Seasonal-level analyses revealed that the risk of experiencing losses due to OVC ashfall at fruit farms is cyclic and fluctuates with time of year and harvest season, with the highest risk experienced during peak harvest season (15 October--14 April) when crop vulnerability is high and westerly winds dominate in the BoP.},

  abstract = {Studies of grain-size distributions of explosive volcanic eruptions provide important insights into fragmentation mechanisms and eruptive conditions and are crucial to the modeling of tephra dispersal. As a result of sedimentation processes and plume dynamics, grain-size features vary significantly both in the downwind and crosswind directions and are difficult to characterize. We have analyzed grain-size features in the downwind and crosswind directions of the two largest eruptions of the last 2000 years of Cotopaxi volcano activity (Ecuador). Crosswind grain-size variations are similar for both eruptions (i.e., layers 3 and 5), while at any given downwind distance from vent, the layer 3 deposit is coarser than the layer 5 one. This suggests that layers 3 and 5 were characterized by similar plume height but that layer 3 was advected by a stronger wind. In addition, both deposits are coarsest along the dispersal axis and become richer in ash in the crosswind direction showing a Gaussian decreasing rate. Deposit thickness also shows a Gaussian crosswind decay, but layer 3 is significantly thicker at all points than is layer 5 due to the former's larger erupted mass. Based on both quantitative analysis of field data and on numerical simulations, we show that tephra deposits associated with large explosive eruptions (i.e., plume height of 30 km) should be sampled out to at least 200 km from the vent (depending on wind speed and tropopause height) in order to derive complete grain-size distributions that are not depleted in fines. Eruptions occurring in a strong wind field at high latitudes (e.g., Iceland) require lesser representative-sampling distances because of the lower tropopause heights.},

The casualties were mainly caused by the impact of ballistic blocks around the summit area. It is necessary to know the magnitude of the block velocity and energy to construct a hazard map of ballistic projectiles and design effective shelters and mountain huts. The ejection velocities of the ballistic projectiles were estimated by comparing the observed distribution of the ballistic impact craters on the ground with simulated distributions of landing positions under various sets of conditions. A three-dimensional numerical multiparticle ballistic model adapted to account for topographic effect was used to estimate the ejection angles. From these simulations, we have obtained an ejection angle of {$\gamma$} = 20{$^\circ$} from vertical to horizontal and {$\alpha$} = 20{$^\circ$} from north to east. With these ejection angle conditions, the ejection speed was estimated to be between 145 and 185 m/s for a previously obtained range of drag coefficients of 0.62--1.01. The order of magnitude of the mean landing energy obtained using our numerical simulation was 104 J.},

  abstract = {The determination of eruptive parameters is crucial in volcanology, not only to document past eruptions, but also for tephra fallout hazard assessments. In most tephra fallout studies, eruptive parameters have been determined either by empirical techniques or analytical models, but the uncertainty of such parameters is usually not well described. We have applied both empirical and analytical models to characterize the climactic phase of the 2450BP Plinian eruption of Pululagua (BF2 layer) and explore the variations in the total erupted mass, column height and total grain size distribution. Both approaches yield comparable results in the total mass of tephra erupted (4.5{\textpm}1.5{\texttimes}1011kg), while they show some discrepancies for the determination of the column height (36--20km from empirical techniques and 30--20km from analytical techniques). The total grain size distribution of the BF2 layers varies with the different techniques used for the calculation and significantly affects the outputs of analytical models. Furthermore, the determination of the total grain size distribution depends strongly on the number and spatial distribution of the sample location. Inverting tephra fallout deposits on the total accumulation (or thickness) gives a good constraint on the total mass erupted but not on the column height. However, inverting on individual grain size classes better constrains the possible range of column heights (but cannot resolve particle release height). Results from the inversion on individual grain size classes show that large diffusion coefficients are necessary to model the BF2 layer and might be required to model proximal tephra deposits in order not to overestimate the total erupted mass. Additionally, we used a statistical method (smoothed bootstrap approach) to quantify the uncertainty in eruptive parameters such as column height and total erupted mass. Our uncertainty analysis yields a mean total erupted mass of 4.5{\textpm}0.3{\texttimes}1011kg and a mean column height of 30{\textpm}3km. Results from the uncertainty analysis compare well with results from other approaches. Finally, although the climactic phase of the 2450BP Plinian eruption of Pululagua occurred in relatively calm atmospheric conditions, our results show that the dispersion of the BF2 layer was influenced by slight northeasterly wind conditions.},

Analyses which plot where the fields overlap include rain-flushed ashes and thin flow deposits. Among factors influencing \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}phi\}\$ of fall deposits is the wind: a strong wind will reduce its value. Another is the characteristics of the initial population-the entire assemblage of fragments coming from the vent-which is quite different for crystals than for pumice or lithic components. Each component in a polycomponent deposit has a different grain-size distribution due to this and subsequent air sorting. Histograms or cumulative curves where the weight percentages are plotted against the fall velocity are shown to be more meaningful than those against the grain size, and a quantity V is defined analogous to \${\textbackslash}phi\$ . Ignimbrites are remarkably homogeneous, but two departures are here described, namely, the relatively well-sorted and sometimes cross-bedded basal layer which is generally (perhaps always) present and the relatively well-sorted pipes which cut some ignimbrites. Finer and lighter components have been partly removed, leaving a concentration of coarser and heavier components. These features help to distinguish nonwelded ignimbrites from mudflows.},

The latter value, called F, varies from less than 20 for deposits in which fragmentation was mainly achieved by the tearing apart of magma, to more than 80 where it was largely due to thermal shock resulting from the quenching of lava by water.},

  abstract = {The principal factor influencing the length of a lava flow is the rate of effusion. With a high rate the lava flows rapidly from the source and tends to form an extensive and far-reaching flow which is simple in character (i.e. made of a single flow unit). With a low rate the lava tends to pile up layer upon layer to form a local accumulation of limited lateral extent near the source, and this accumulation is strongly compound in character (i.e. divisible into flow units). The initial viscosity affects the length indirectly by controlling the thickness of the extrusion, and this thickness control is capable of accounting for the fact that the median length of low-viscosity basaltic extrusions is 3.2 times that of high-viscosity andesite, trachyte and rhyolite ones. Other factors, such as the local topography, are thought to be relatively unimportant, an exception being when lava is ponded in a topographic depression. Measurement of the rate of effusion may be critical in any attempt to predict the distance that a lava flow will travel, such as the one which threatened Fornazzo and other towns and villages on Etna in 1971.}

  abstract = {Tumuli are positive topographic features that are common on Hawaiian pahoehoe lava flow fields, particularly on shallow slopes, and 75 measured examples are presented here to document the size range. Tumuli form by up-tilting of crustal plates, without any crustal shortening, and are thus distinguished from pressure ridges which are up-buckled by laterally directed pressure. The axial or star-like systems of deep clefts that characterize tumuli are defined here as ``lava-inflation clefts''; their tips advanced into red-hot lava and they widened as uplift proceeded and while the lava crust was thickening. Flat-surfaced uplifts, formed like tumuli by injection of lava under a surface crust, were previously called pressure plateaus, but ``lava rise'' is proposed instead. The pits that abound among lava rises, previously attributed to collapse or subsidence, are generally formed because the lava around them rose, and the name ``lava-rise pit'' is proposed. Unique examples of tumuli and lava rises, from which lava drained out under a surface crust 1.5 to 2.5 m thick, are described from Kilauea caldera. These examples show that in tumuli and lava rises the crust floats on considerable bodies of fluid lava, and is able to do so because of its higher vesicle content: the fluid lava loses many of its gas bubbles during residence beneath the crust. The bulk densities of samples from tumuli show a general downward increase. The form of the density profile is consistent with the relationship that for any given crustal thickness the density of fluid lava closely matched the average density of that crust, suggesting that the lava was stably density-stratified. It is inferred that stable stratification was regulated by out-flows of the more vesicular lava fractions, loss of bubbles through the lava-inflation clefts, and entry of injected lava at its level of neutral buoyancy. Below the uppermost meter the downward decrease in vesicularity closely conforms with that expected by compression of a uniform mass of gas per unit mass of lava.},

  abstract = {Tephra from large explosive eruptions can cause damage to buildings over wide geographical areas, creating a variety of issues for post-eruption recovery. This means that evaluating the extent and nature of likely building damage from future eruptions is an important aspect of volcanic risk assessment. However, our ability to make accurate assessments is currently limited by poor characterisation of how buildings perform under varying tephra loads. This study presents a method to remotely assess building damage to increase the quantity of data available for developing new tephra fall building vulnerability models. Given the large number of damaged buildings and the high potential for loss in future eruptions, we use the Kelud 2014 eruption as a case study. A total of 1154 buildings affected by falls 1--10 cm thick were assessed, with 790 showing signs that they sustained damage in the time between pre- and post-eruption satellite image acquisitions. Only 27 of the buildings surveyed appear to have experienced severe roof or building collapse. Damage was more commonly characterised by collapse of roof overhangs and verandas or damage that required roof cladding replacement. To estimate tephra loads received by each building we used Tephra2 inversion and interpolation of hand-contoured isopachs on the same set of deposit measurements. Combining tephra loads from both methods with our damage assessment, we develop the first sets of tephra fall fragility curves that consider damage severities lower than severe roof collapse. Weighted prediction accuracies are calculated for the curves using K-fold cross validation, with scores between 0.68 and 0.75 comparable to those for fragility curves developed for other natural hazards. Remote assessment of tephra fall building damage is highly complementary to traditional field-based surveying and both approaches should ideally be adopted to improve our understanding of tephra fall impacts following future damaging eruptions.},

The physical differences between three common types of explosive volcanic activity, typified by plinian, strombolian and vulcanian events, are reviewed and simple mathematical models are proposed for them. The models relate velocities of ejects to initial pressures at the start of an explosive phase and to mass fractions of volatiles (generally taken to be water) in the explosion products. When fitted to observed ejects velocities (or velocities deduced from the dispersal of debris) up to 500 m/s the models predict pressures up to 300 bars --- almost always much lower than those deduced in earlier treatments.},

When this is done, it is found that previously published estimates of exsolved magma volatile contents obtained from the analysis of pyroclast size distributions in near-vent deposits overestimate the volatile content by approximately 20 per cent in the case of Plinian eruptions. The discrepancy is much worse for pyroclast size distributions skewed towards coarse clasts, as is common in basaltic lava fountains; in such cases pyroclast dispersal studies may overestimate the exsolved magma volatile content by at least 200 per cent. An analogous problem arises if released magma volatile amounts deduced from studies of fluid inclusions in pyroclasts are inserted into most current computer models of eruption dynamics, but the gas eruption speeds deduced have an even larger error, being underestimated by up to 300 per cent in the case of coarse-grained eruptions. The more sophisticated of the currently available numerical models of eruption dynamics can in principle avoid this problem, but practical implementation limitations have so far prevented such models being run with a sufficiently wide range of grain sizes for the importance of these effects to be fully appreciated.},

  abstract = {Tephra fall from the August 1991 eruption of Volcan Hudson affected some 100,000 km(2) of Patagonia and was almost immediately reworked by strong winds, creating billowing clouds of remobilised ash, or 'ash storms'. The immediate impacts on agriculture and rural communities were severe, but were then greatly exacerbated by continuing ash storms. This paper describes the findings of a 3-week study tour of the diverse environments of southern Patagonia affected by ash storms, with an emphasis on determining the impacts of repeated ash storms on agriculture and local practices that were developed in an attempt to mitigate these impacts. Ash storms produce similar effects to initial tephra eruptions, prolonged for considerable periods. These have included the burial of farmland under dune deposits, abrasion of vegetation and contamination of feed supplies with fine ash. These impacts can then cause problems for grazing animals such as starvation, severe tooth abrasion, gastrointestinal problems, corneal abrasion and blindness, and exhaustion if sheep fleeces become laden with ash. In addition, ash storms have led to exacerbated soil erosion, human health impacts, increased cleanup requirements, sedimentation in irrigation canals, and disruption of aviation and land transport. Ash deposits were naturally stabilised most rapidly in areas with high rainfall ({$>$} 1,500 mm/year) through compaction and enhanced vegetation growth. Stabilisation was slowest in windy, semi-arid regions. Destruction of vegetation and suppression of regrowth by heavy tephra fall ({$>$} 100 mm) hindered the stabilisation of deposits for years, and reduced the surface friction which increased wind erosivity. Stabilisation of tephra deposits was improved by intensive tillage, use of windbreaks and where there was dense and taller vegetative cover. Long-term drought and the impracticality of mixing ash deposits with soil by tillage on large farms was a barrier to stabilising deposits and, in turn, agricultural recovery. The continuing ash storms motivated the partial evacuation of small rural towns such as Chile Chico (Chile) and Los Antiguos (Argentina) in September-December 1991, after the primary tephra fall in August 1991. Greatly increased municipal cleanup efforts had to be sustained beyond the initial tephra fall to cope with the ongoing impacts of ash storms. Throughout the 1990s, ash storms contributed to continued population migration out of the affected area, leaving hundreds of farms abandoned on the Argentine steppe. The major lesson from our study is the importance of stabilisation of ash deposits as soon as possible after the initial eruption, particularly in windy, arid climates. Suggested mitigation measures include deep cultivation of the ash into the soil and erecting windbreaks.},

As they become more widely used, their exposure to volcanic hazards will increase. Therefore, understanding how laptops will function in volcanic environments is necessary to provide suitable mitigation options. In this study, laptop computers were subjected to volcanic ash and gas in both laboratory and field settings. None of the laptops sustained permanent damage in laboratory experiments; however, ash contamination did reduce the functionality of keyboards, CD drives, and cooling fans. Several laptops shut down temporarily due to overheating following ash contamination. In field experiments, laptops were exposed to high concentrations of volcanic gases at White Island, New Zealand. These laptops did not sustain permanent damage as only a small amount of gas was able to enter the laptops. However, metal components on the outside of the laptop did sustain minor corrosion. Re-examination of the laptops after 6 months indicated they were in full working order. Printed circuit boards suffered significant corrosion damage and ceased working only when in direct and sustained contact with volcanic gases. Simple mitigation techniques such as isolating laptops inside heavy duty polyethylene bags were effective. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that laptops have a relatively low risk of damage from volcanic ash and gas exposure, but have a low-medium risk of loss of functionality in ash environments. We think this has implications for other electronic equipment used extensively in critical infrastructure services.},

  abstract = {Abstract Effective natural hazard risk assessment requires the characterisation of both hazards and vulnerabilities of exposed elements. Volcanic hazard assessment is at an advanced state and is a considerable focus of volcanic scientific inquiry, whereas comprehensive vulnerability assessment is lacking. Cataloguing and analysing volcanic impacts provide insight on likely societal and physical vulnerabilities during future eruptions. This paper reviews documented disruption and physical damage of critical infrastructure elements resulting from four volcanic hazards (tephra fall, pyroclastic density currents, lava flows and lahars) of eruptions in the last 100 years. We define critical infrastructure as including energy sector infrastructure, water supply and wastewater networks, transportation routes, communications, and critical components. Common trends of impacts and vulnerabilities are summarised, which can be used to assess and reduce volcanic risk for future eruptions. In general, tephra falls cause disruption to these infrastructure sectors, reducing their functionality, whilst flow hazards (pyroclastic density currents, lava flows and lahars) are more destructive causing considerable permanent damage. Volcanic risk assessment should include quantification of vulnerabilities and we challenge the volcanology community to address this through the implementation of a standardised vulnerability assessment methodology and the development and use of fragility functions, as has been successfully implemented in other natural hazard fields.},

Volcanic ash is convected upwards within the eruption column and carried downwind, falling out of suspension and potentially affecting communities across hundreds of square kilometers. Although ash falls rarely endanger human life directly, threats to public health and disruption to critical infrastructure services, aviation, and primary production (e.g. agriculture) can lead to significant societal impacts. Even relatively small eruptions such as the Eyjafjallaj??kull eruption in Iceland in 2010 (Volcanic Explosivity Index of 4) can cause widespread disruption, damage, and economic loss. Knowledge of the likely impacts can support mitigation actions, crisis planning, and emergency management activities. This chapter presents an overview of ash fall impacts for sectors of society including buildings, critical infrastructure, and agriculture; and discuss associated socioeconomic factors. We also discuss the likely response (vulnerability) of these key sectors to ash fall impacts. Broad relationships between volcanic ash thickness and levels of damage and disruption have been outlined. Understanding these vulnerabilities is an essential step towards building resilience for communities.},

  abstract = {Volcanic risk assessment using probabilistic models is increasingly desired for risk management, particularly for loss forecasting, critical infrastructure management, land-use planning and evacuation planning. Over the past decades this has motivated the development of comprehensive probabilistic hazard models. However, volcanic vulnerability models of equivalent sophistication have lagged behind hazard modelling because of the lack of evidence, data and, until recently, minimal demand. There is an increasingly urgent need for development of quantitative volcanic vulnerability models, including vulnerability and fragility functions, which provide robust quantitative relationships between volcanic impact (damage and disruption) and hazard intensity. The functions available to date predominantly quantify tephra fall impacts to buildings, driven by life safety concerns. We present a framework for establishing quantitative relationships between volcanic impact and hazard intensity, specifically through the derivation of vulnerability and fragility functions. We use tephra thickness and impacts to key infrastructure sectors as examples to demonstrate our framework. Our framework incorporates impact data sources, different impact intensity scales, preparation and fitting of data, uncertainty analysis and documentation. The primary data sources are post-eruption impact assessments, supplemented by laboratory experiments and expert judgment, with the latter drawing upon a wealth of semi-quantitative and qualitative studies. Different data processing and function fitting techniques can be used to derive functions; however, due to the small datasets currently available, simplified approaches are discussed. We stress that documentation of data processing, assumptions and limitations is the most important aspect of function derivation; documentation provides transparency and allows others to update functions more easily. Following our standardised approach, a volcanic risk scientist can derive a fragility or vulnerability function, which then can be easily compared to existing functions and updated as new data become available. To demonstrate how to apply our framework, we derive fragility and vulnerability functions for discrete tephra fall impacts to electricity supply, water supply, wastewater and transport networks. These functions present the probability of an infrastructure site or network component equalling or exceeding one of four impact states as a function of tephra thickness.},

The NDVI provides an absolute metrics for vegetation condition. However, a relative measurement of the current vegetation condition against a reference vegetation condition is critical for understanding, interpreting and quantifying the current vegetation condition. In this paper, a new NDVI based vegetation condition index is presented to measure the vegetation condition with respect to the "normal condition", which is characterized by historical average.

  abstract = {Tephra thickness distribution is the primary piece of information used to reconstruct the histories of past explosive volcanic eruptions. We present a method for modeling tephra thickness with less subjectivity than is the case with hand-drawn isopachs, the current, most frequently used method. The algorithm separates the thickness of a tephra fall deposit into a trend and local variations and models them separately using segmented linear regression and ordinary kriging. The distance to the source vent and downwind distance are used to characterize the trend model. The algorithm is applied to thickness datasets for the Fogo Member A and North Mono Bed 1 tephras. Simulations on subsets of data and cross-validation are implemented to test the effectiveness of the algorithm in the construction of the trend model and the model of local variations. The results indicate that model isopach maps and volume estimations are consistent with previous studies and point to some inconsistencies in hand-drawn maps and their interpretation. The most striking feature noticed in hand-drawn mapping is a lack of adherence to the data in drawing isopachs locally. Since the model assumes a stable wind field, divergences from the predicted decrease in thickness with distance are readily noticed. Hence, wind direction, although weak in the case of Fogo A, was not unidirectional during deposition. A combination of the isopach algorithm with a new, data transformation can be used to estimate the extent of fall deposits. A limitation of the algorithm is that one must estimate ``by hand'' the wind direction based on the thickness data.},
