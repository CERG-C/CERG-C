Derived maps are particularly fuzzy in these terms, since they generally overlap hazard lines with critical emergency/facilities elements.  The meaning of Sakurajima map lines is clearly defined, delimiting the when and how a volcanic phenomena is expected, hence, the exposure elements on the background are informative and not interefering with vulnerability and/or resilience metrics.

From a scientist point of view, precision on [HIM] and the associated uncertainties is fundamental. According to the survey, the main concern of residents would be the possibility of any tephra at all impacting their land (10 mm was already to high for certain interviewees). Many participants therefore suggest that additional text explaining the possible impacts associated with a given ash thickness would make the map more relevant and useful. </p> <p>In words of an interviewee: \"The question is 'Will I get ash?'...Not, 'how much will I get?'...They're not sort of thinking 'We can do this with 10 milimeters; we can do this with 100'.

However, <code>Q-LavHA</code> uses a probabilistic approach to estimate this flow direction. </p> <p>Firstly, as we saw, a lava flow is a Non-Newtonian fluid with yield strength, which means that it can escape the steepest path and propagate laterally, fill depressions and overcome topographical obstacles. To account for that, <code>Q-LavHA</code> introduces 2 corrective factors:</p> <ul> <li>\\(H_c\\), representing the flow thickness.</li> <li>\\(H_p\\), representing the ability of a flow to inflate. </li> </ul> <p>Together, these two parameters help avoiding the modelled flow getting stuck in topographic low and will allow it to spread laterally, as we saw the 2021 flow of La Palma was able to do. </p> <p>Secondly, the initial estimation of path of steepest descent is performed stochastically similarly to what we previously looked at. Conceptually, one <code>Q-LavHA</code> output is constituted by the simulation of thousands of lava flows (1500 by default). Each lava flow simulation applies a path of steepest descent approach, but the selection of the next pixel is performed slightly differently:</p> <ol> <li>At each new pixel, the \\(H_c\\) and \\(H_p\\) corrections are applied to the active pixel according to Figure 1.</li> <li>Instead of selecting the pixel with the largest \\(|\\Delta h|\\) as previously seen, <code>Q-LavHA</code> assigns a relative probability of flow inundation to each surrounding pixel (see box below). </li> <li>Using a random number generator, <code>Q-LavHA</code> stochastically sample which pixel will be inundated next.

This force balance also needs to be reproduced in laboratory experiments, although the highest values of the Froude number suggest that inertial forces can be dominant in some cases. Finally, the Savage, Bagnold and Darcy numbers suggest that particle collisions do not have a predominant role on the flow dynamics, that are rather influenced by the presence of interstitial pore fluid pressure.

In volcanology, analogue modelling is a major tool to understand the physics of volcanic processes in complement to field, theoretical and numerical works. In fact, it is not always possible to observe volcanic phenomena, and observations do not provide directly all the information on processes, notably because volcanic eruptions and specific phenomena are relatively rare, often dangerous to study and sometimes happen in remote areas<sup>2</sup>. Moreover, natural volcanic phenomena are very complex and involve several processes simultaneously, possibly leading to equivocal interpretation of their dynamics.</p> <p>The strength of laboratory experiments is to provide simple and repeatable analogue models of volcanic phenomena that involve few, well-characterised and well-controlled physical parameters.

Some very simple models can help to illustrate fundamental physical processes driving volcanic phenomena (e.g., \"vinegar volcanoes\" illustrate the role of gases in the triggering of eruptions). The goal of these models is to visualise processes qualitatively, but analogue modelling can also be used to study these processes quantitatively, by measuring variables and assessing the influence of particular parameters on model's results. Quantitative models are widely used to understand the physics involved in natural processes.</p> <p>How is it possible to learn something on natural processes from small scale analogue models?</p> <p>By definition, a model never equals the complexity of the real world and is never a complete representation of the world; i.e. \"all models are inherently wrong, but some are useful\"<sup>24</sup>. Critical differences exist between natural processes and their laboratory analogues. In fact, for large scale natural processes such as volcanic eruptions, experimental models are inevitably spatially and temporally simplified and reduced to be conceivable at the scale of a laboratory. Even \"large scale experiments\" (i.e., with sizes up to several 10s of meters<sup>16</sup><sup>18</sup>), which try to better approach natural scales, are orders of magnitude smaller than natural phenomena.</p> <p>In order to assess the reliability of small-scale analogue models to simulate natural processes, and design appropriate models, experimental modellers need to ensure that laboratory experiments correctly reproduce the balance of forces acting in natural systems by conducting a scaling analysis. If the ratio of forces acting on experimental models is matching that acting on natural systems, models are dynamically similar to natural processes. Hence, the dynamics of scaled experimental models can be characteristic of much larger systems. </p> <p>The relation between analogue and numerical modelling</p> <pre><code> Like other approches, analogue modelling is not sufficient to fully understand complex volcanic phenomena alone. **Multidisciplinary** efforts, including field observations, numerical modelling, and analogue modelling are therefore classically used in volcanology. Observations and measurements from natural volcanic phenomena provide the parameters and initial conditions for analogue and [numerical models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_modeling_(geology)).
