# Changelog

## 2023-04-21

- Started organising all classes in subsections in the `Teaching` folder. That requires each class to have a separate `img` folder for storing images.
  - Only did the Bachelor class for now

## 2022-07-24

- The website was moved from an **organisation** (CERG-C.github.io) to a **project** (CERG-C) Github page.
- Now CERG-C.github.io contains only an `index.html` page with an automatic redirection.
