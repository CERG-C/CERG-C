# Analogue modelling of volcanic processes

[Analogue modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogue_modelling_(geology)) (also referred to as laboratory modelling) is an experimental approach that is used in the Earth Sciences to investigate geological processes in a **laboratory** at convenient time and length scales[^1]. In volcanology, analogue modelling is a **major tool** to understand the physics of volcanic processes in complement to field, theoretical and numerical works. In fact, it is not always possible to observe volcanic phenomena, and observations do not provide directly all the information on processes, notably because volcanic eruptions and specific phenomena are relatively rare, often dangerous to study and sometimes happen in remote areas[^2]. Moreover, **natural volcanic phenomena are very complex** and involve several processes simultaneously, possibly leading to equivocal interpretation of their dynamics.

The strength of laboratory experiments is to provide **simple** and **repeatable** analogue models of volcanic phenomena that involve **few**, **well-characterised** and **well-controlled** physical parameters. Volcanologists have therefore used analogue modelling to study many processes[^3]. Examples are shown below.

 It depends on the purpose of the model. Some very simple models can help to illustrate fundamental physical processes driving volcanic phenomena (e.g., ["vinegar volcanoes"](https://fun-science.org.uk/vinegar-volcano-experiment/) illustrate the role of gases in the triggering of eruptions). The goal of these models is to visualise processes **qualitatively**, but analogue modelling can also be used to study these processes **quantitatively**, by measuring variables and assessing the influence of particular parameters on model's results. Quantitative models are widely used to understand the physics involved in natural processes.

!!! help "How is it possible to learn something on natural processes from small scale analogue models?"

  By definition, **a model never equals the complexity of the real world** and is never a complete representation of the world; i.e. "all models are inherently wrong, but some are useful"[^24]. Critical differences exist between natural processes and their laboratory analogues. In fact, for **large scale natural processes** such as volcanic eruptions, experimental models are inevitably spatially and temporally **simplified** and **reduced** to be conceivable at the scale of a laboratory. Even "large scale experiments" (i.e., with sizes up to several 10s of meters[^16][^18]), which try to better approach natural scales, are orders of magnitude smaller than natural phenomena.
  
  In order to assess the reliability of small-scale analogue models to simulate natural processes, and design appropriate models, experimental modellers need to ensure that laboratory experiments correctly **reproduce the balance of forces** acting in natural systems by conducting a **scaling analysis**. If the ratio of forces acting on experimental models is matching that acting on natural systems, models are **dynamically similar** to natural processes. Hence, the dynamics of **scaled** experimental models can be characteristic of much larger systems. 

!!! info "The relation between analogue and numerical modelling"

         Like other approches, analogue modelling is not sufficient to fully understand complex volcanic phenomena alone. **Multidisciplinary** efforts, including field observations, numerical modelling, and analogue modelling are therefore classically used in volcanology. Observations and measurements from natural volcanic phenomena provide the parameters and initial conditions for analogue and [numerical models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_modeling_(geology)). These models are then tested against nature, with analogue models also aiding the development of numerical models[^3].
