They therefore propagate laterally because the current's density exceeds that of the ambient atmosphere. Investigations have shown that PDCs exhibit a large range of particle concentrations, even within a single PDC. In the past, PDCs were classically separated in pyroclastic surges (for dilute flows with particle concentrations &lt; 1 vol.%) and pyroclastic flows (for dense particle mixtures), but the general term \"PDC\" is now preferred.

Analogue models must therefore reproduce flows in the turbulent regime in order to be similar to natural PDCs. Moreover, the Grashof and Froude numbers highlight the importance of buoyancy over inertial forces. This force balance also needs to be reproduced in laboratory experiments, although the highest values of the Froude number suggest that inertial forces can be dominant in some cases. Finally, the Savage, Bagnold and Darcy numbers suggest that particle collisions do not have a predominant role on the flow dynamics, that are rather influenced by the presence of interstitial pore fluid pressure. Laboratory experiments studying the behaviour of dense PDCs naturally used granular mixtures to study the role of interstitial fluid pressure on the flow dynamics2\\(^,\\)5.</p> <p>Dilute flows<p>Experimental investigations also adressed the transport of solid particles within dilute flows, where particles are carried by the turbulent fluid phase.

In volcanology, analogue modelling is a major tool to understand the physics of volcanic processes in complement to field, theoretical and numerical works. In fact, it is not always possible to observe volcanic phenomena, and observations do not provide directly all the information on processes, notably because volcanic eruptions and specific phenomena are relatively rare, often dangerous to study and sometimes happen in remote areas2. Moreover, natural volcanic phenomena are very complex and involve several processes simultaneously, possibly leading to equivocal interpretation of their dynamics.</p> <p>The strength of laboratory experiments is to provide simple and repeatable analogue models of volcanic phenomena that involve few, well-characterised and well-controlled physical parameters. Volcanologists have therefore used analogue modelling to study many processes3. Examples are shown below.</p> Magma convection, mixing and riseLava flows and domesExplosive eruptions <p> Figure 1: Analogue modelling of magmatic processes investigating the physics of: magma mixing4(A1-A5), convection5(B), magmatic intrusions6(C) and gas bubble ascent into a volcanic conduit7(D).

E: Analogue models of tephra sedimentation (E1: volcanic ash settling from a volcanic cloud22, E2: tephra deposition in oceans23).  </p> <p>Is a volcano made of baking soda and vinegar a good analogue model of a real volcano?</p> <p>It depends on the purpose of the model. Some very simple models can help to illustrate fundamental physical processes driving volcanic phenomena (e.g., \"vinegar volcanoes\" illustrate the role of gases in the triggering of eruptions). The goal of these models is to visualise processes qualitatively, but analogue modelling can also be used to study these processes quantitatively, by measuring variables and assessing the influence of particular parameters on model's results. Quantitative models are widely used to understand the physics involved in natural processes.</p> <p>How is it possible to learn something on natural processes from small scale analogue models?</p> <p>By definition, a model never equals the complexity of the real world and is never a complete representation of the world; i.e. \"all models are inherently wrong, but some are useful\"24. Critical differences exist between natural processes and their laboratory analogues. In fact, for large scale natural processes such as volcanic eruptions, experimental models are inevitably spatially and temporally simplified and reduced to be conceivable at the scale of a laboratory. Even \"large scale experiments\" (i.e., with sizes up to several 10s of meters1618), which try to better approach natural scales, are orders of magnitude smaller than natural phenomena.</p> <p>In order to assess the reliability of small-scale analogue models to simulate natural processes, and design appropriate models, experimental modellers need to ensure that laboratory experiments correctly reproduce the balance of forces acting in natural systems by conducting a scaling analysis. If the ratio of forces acting on experimental models is matching that acting on natural systems, models are dynamically similar to natural processes. Hence, the dynamics of scaled experimental models can be characteristic of much larger systems. </p> <p>The relation between analogue and numerical modelling<p>Like other approches, analogue modelling is not sufficient to fully understand complex volcanic phenomena alone. Multidisciplinary efforts, including field observations, numerical modelling, and analogue modelling are therefore classically used in volcanology. Observations and measurements from natural volcanic phenomena provide the parameters and initial conditions for analogue and numerical models. These models are then tested against nature, with analogue models also aiding the development of numerical models3.</p> </p> <p></p> Figure 4: A flow diagram to represent the optimal approach to use analogue and numerical modelling in volcanology.

Over the past years, volcanic crises in Hawaii in 2018, in DRC and La Palma in 2021 have demonstrated the difficulty in managing these long\u2013lasting crises. This is due to the fact that lava flows are governed by complex rheological processes, making their paths hard to predict. As a result, forecasts are often associated with large uncertainties that makes them unusable during crisis management.</p> <p>Does this mean that we are helpless in reducing the risk associated with lava flows?</p> <p>Well, no, not entirely. In this exercise, we will differentiate between various purposes of hazard (and risk!) assessments for different parts of the risk cycle, contrasting between actions taken long before the event during the prevention phase - where the idea here is to plan ahead to reduce the risk - and actions taken short before or during the event in the preparedness and response phases - where the aim is to minimise immediate impacts.

These repeated crises have provided important lessons on how to communicate hazard uncertainties during crises. During the 2014 crisis, the flow field was dangerously heading towards the town of P\u0101hoa. Under pressure from decision makers, HVO attempted to provide a forecast and estimated that the flow might reach the town of P\u0101hoa within a few to tens of days... only that the media only reported the \"a few\" days, creating panic amongst the community.</p> <p>HVO realised the difficulty in communicating such a large uncertainty in operational activities and decided to cease providing forecasts. Instead, they reverted back to the steepest descent method which, although over-simplifying complex flow-emplacement processes, has the benefit of being transparent. In addition, HVO conducted meetings with stakeholders, agencies and the public, where they explained the limitations encountered when modeling lava flows.

An eruption scenario represents what we expect to be a possible future eruption behaviour based on our knowledge of the volcanic system. Concretely, an eruption scenario is defined by a spectrum of possible values that each ESP could exhibit during a future eruption. Probabilistic modeling requires to define ESPs not as single but as distributions of values, generally defined as:</p> <ol> <li>A range of values (i.e., the <code>minimum</code> and <code>maximum</code> values to explore).</li> <li>A shape of distribution. </li> </ol> <p>Let's go back to the Cotopaxi eruption presented above. The plume height estimated from the study of the deposit is 25 km. Based on our knowledge, we might postulate that a plume height of 25 km is indeed likely for a future eruption but want to acknowledge that our level of uncertainty may allow the plume height to vary between 20-30 km. In this case, we might adopt a <code>normal</code> distribution as shown in Figure 3.</p> <p></p> Figure 3: Starting from a deterministic (i.e., reference eruption) approach (left), an eruption scenario is defined by i) identifying a range (center) and a distribution (right) for each ESP. <p>We need to repeat this process for all ESP relevant for the model used.

We have briefly discussed this at the end of this module, but let's review again what uncertainties are and where they are originating from.</p> <p>Conceptually, uncertainties can be classified in two categories:</p> <p>Uncertainties</p> <ul> <li>Epistemic uncertainty  derives from the lack of knowledge regarding a phenomena. In theory, we could reduce epistemic uncertainties if more observations of the phenomena were available to help us better constrain the underlying processes and behaviours.</li> <li>Aleatoric uncertainty is associated with the inherent randomness of natural processes. Nothing much we can do about it, really!</li> </ul> <p>Figure 4 illustrates four different distributions that have been used in the literature to express ESP variability. These distributions combine both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. Although a better characterisation of the epistemic uncertainty would help to refine the top left distribution towards a distribution centered on a best guess values, the constant presence of an aleatoric component of uncertainty is the reason why the bottom right distribution is impossible to achieve.</p> <p>Probability distributions for ESP</p> <p> Figure 4: Illustration of various probability distributions used for EPS sampling </p> <ul> <li>The top left example is a <code>uniform</code> distribution: In this case, any value between <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> has an equal probability of occurrence. This is often referred to as a maximum level of ignorance. </li> <li>The top right example is a <code>normal</code> distribution: Here we assume that a central value has the highest probability of occurrence, but it can divert from it in a symmetrical fashion.</li> <li>The bottom left example is a <code>logarithmic</code> distribution: In this case, we assume that smaller values have higher probabilities of occurrence than larger ones. For instance, large earthquakes occur more often than small ones. </li> <li>Finally, the bottom right example represent an unrealistic case where <code>min</code>=<code>max</code>. This would only occur if there was no uncertainty.</li> </ul> <p>The critical objective here is to attempt to translate our knowledge of the volcanic system into realistic eruption scenarios. But how do we improve our knowledge and therefore reduce epistemic uncertainties around ESPs? </p> <p>Pragmatically, there are three main directions to do so:</p> <ol> <li>Field studies \u2192 Ideally, identifying the range of ESPs is based on extensive field studies. By reconstructing the stratigraphy of a volcanic edifice, we can study its past eruptive history, which is then used to estimate the potential future eruption scenarios. </li> <li>Literature review \u2192 This personal knowledge is then usually complemented by published literature. </li> <li>Analogues \u2192 However, for volcanoes with a poor geological record, it is often necessary to extend our knowledge based on analogue volcanoes or eruptions.

For the purpose of this exercise, let's consider that the risk \\(R\\) can be defined as a function of at least 3 components that are:</p> <ul> <li>\\(H\\) - hazard - expressing the spatial (and temporal) distribution of the intensity of a hazardous phenomenon.</li> <li>\\(E\\) - elements at risk - expressing the presence of exposed populations, assets, goods, natural features, ecosystem services etc. to the hazardous phenomenon. </li> <li>\\(V\\) - vulnerability - expressing how the exposed element will be negatively impacted as a function of the hazard intensity. </li> </ul> <p>The most fundamental definition of risk is defined as \\(R = f(H,E,V)\\). Although this exercise focuses on hazard, a meaningful discussion of hazard outputs usually borrows some concept of vulnerability to illustrate results. </p> <p>Ideally, all facets of vulnerability would be described by continuous and quantitative mathematical functions (also able to characterize the associated uncertainties). Amongst these, we distinguish between fragility and vulnerability functions (see below). These curves are typically primarily sourced in empirical post-event impact assessments, starting from in situ observations of impacts following disasters, and complemented with additional investigations (e.g., analytical, experimental, numerical).</p> <pre><code>\n    flowchart LR\n\n        subgraph pre-EIA\n            B[\"Fragility/vulnerability curves\"]    \n        end\n\n        subgraph post-EIA\n            A0[\"Thresholds\"] --&gt; A[\"Damage/Disruption states\"]\n        end\n\n        pre-EIA --&gt; post-EIA\n        post-EIA --&gt; C[\"Experimental + numerical\"] --&gt; pre-EIA\n</code></pre> <p>Practically, the relatively low frequency of volcanic eruptions compared to other natural hazards limits the availability of opportunistic post-event impact assessments: this impedes the development of accurate, quantitative fragility/vulnerability functions. As a result, most current vulnerability models in volcanology rely on empirical post-event impact assessments, which are discrete, semi-quantitative scales based on hazard thresholds corresponding to the onset of specific observed impacts8:</p> Type Description Threshold Hazard intensity thresholds for onset of a given impact. Weak buildings are typically assume to start collapsing at tephra thicknesses of 100-300 \\(kg/m^2\\), although this is highly dependent on the building morphology, quality and on the properties of the deposit. Damage/disruption states (DDS) Stepwise categorisation of impact as a function of hazard intensity. On example is to assume that pastoral agriculture can suffer production losses &lt;50%, &gt;50%, and total for accumulations of 25, 60 and 100 mm of tephra8. Fragility function Mathematical function expressing the probability of a level of impact being equalled or exceeded for a given hazard intensity8.

This shortcoming is rooted in two main causes. On the one hand, eruptions are complex multi-hazard events. Each eruptions style is associated with specific hazards: for instance, the hazards associated with Strombolian eruptions are different than those associated with phreatomagmatic or Plinian events. These hazards evolve in space and time, creating complex vulnerability patterns. On the other hand, volcanic eruptions are less frequent than other natural hazards. As a consequence, and our empirical dataset of observations available to predict future impacts based on past lessons is more limited, which impedes the development of operational impact models.</p> <p>The Global Volcanic Hazards and Risk book, published in 2015 in the context of the GAR report, contains a chapter entitled Volcanic ash fall hazard and risk by Jenkins et al.6.

Starting from field observations, the class will review how parent magma rises to the surface and identify the processes that control the behaviour of the associated phenomena (i.e., effusive vs explosive, fall vs flow etc.). Once identified, these processes will be investigated using controlled experiments in the lab and numerical modelling, and will be use to explore how and why i) natural phenomena becomes hazards and ii) how hazards become a risk to communities.</p> <p>The class is split into two modules in the fall and spring semesters.</p>"},{"location":"modelling_intro/#fall","title":"Fall","text":"<p>The fall part of the class consists in Modelling Volcanic Processes.
