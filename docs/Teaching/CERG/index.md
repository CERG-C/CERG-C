This page contains the teaching material for the Physical Volcanology and Volcanic Risk modules of the CERG-C. It contains both **theory** and the **exercises**, which will get you started for the week in the field in La Palma. The module contains the following classes:

- Theory behind hazard assessments and hazard maps
- Hazard assessment for lava flows 
- Hazard assessment for tephra fallout

The lava flow exercise requires QGIS, so check out this introduction first!
