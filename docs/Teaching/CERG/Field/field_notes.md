- **Group 1**: Which hazardous gases are more likely to be associated with an eruptive event?                                
- **Group 2**: Which hazardous gases do you expect to find in the (a) crater fumaroles (b) and in the flanks of the volcano? 
- **Group 3**: What parameters control the dispersion of gas in craters? And in diffuse degassing areas?
  - Diffuse: Seasonality (higher concentrations in winter, lower in summer)              
- **Group 4**: Which are the volcanic gases that may act as toxic and irritant?                                              
- **Group 5**: Which are the volcanic gases that may act as asphyxiant? 


- **Concentration** and **exposition time** are two hazard impact metrics
  - Radon: Exposition time
  - CO$_2$: Short term
- CO$_2$ is an important gas for monitoring as it is the last one that dissolves from the magma â†’ precursor
