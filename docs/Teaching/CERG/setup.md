# Setting up your computer

This tutorial provides the necessary information on how to setup your personal computer for the hazard assessment class we will do as part of the volcanology module. Namely, we will:

1. Install [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) and the associated plugin [Qâ€“LavHA](https://we.vub.ac.be/en/q-lavha) [@Mossoux2016], a model for the probabilistic hazard assessment of lava flows.
2. Install Matlab and [TephraProb](https://github.com/e5k/TephraProb)

!!! danger "Use your user disk!"

    If you are using the **PC of the computer lab**, make sure **your files are saved on your personal drive!** This is typically the `H:\` drive. Otherwise, your files **will be deleted every time you logout!**
