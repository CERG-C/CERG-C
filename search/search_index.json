This part of the exercise assumes that you have already installed both QGIS and Q-LavHA . The Q-LavHA user manual contains some important information about how to configure the model and the data, so we encourage you to have a look at it at some point. Objectives Review the theory behind Q-LavHA . Understand the main assumptions behind the use of the model. Perform probabilistic lava flow modeling for several vents in La Palma. Account for the uncertainty in vent locations in hazard assessments. Theory behind Q-LavHA Flow direction The starting philosophy behind Q-LavHA is similar to the analysis performed for the path of steepest descent approach: using the DEM , the model will try to estimate where the flow will go next based on the maximum \\(\\Delta h\\) of the surrounding pixels. However, Q-LavHA uses a probabilistic approach to estimate this flow direction. Firstly, as we saw, a lava flow is a Non-Newtonian fluid with yield strength, which means that it can escape the steepest path and propagate laterally, fill depressions and overcome topographical obstacles. To account for that, Q-LavHA introduces 2 corrective factors: \\(H_c\\) , representing the flow thickness . \\(H_p\\) , representing the ability of a flow to inflate . Together, these two parameters help avoiding the modelled flow getting stuck in topographic low and will allow it to spread laterally, as we saw the 2021 flow of La Palma was able to do. Secondly, the initial estimation of path of steepest descent is performed stochastically similarly to what we previously looked at . Conceptually, one Q-LavHA output is constituted by the simulation of thousands of lava flows (1500 by default). Each lava flow simulation applies a path of steepest descent approach, but the selection of the next pixel is performed slightly differently: At each new pixel, the \\(H_c\\) and \\(H_p\\) corrections are applied to the active pixel according to Figure 1. Instead of selecting the pixel with the largest \\(|\\Delta h|\\) as previously seen , Q-LavHA assigns a relative probability of flow inundation to each surrounding pixel (see box below). Using a random number generator, Q-LavHA stochastically sample which pixel will be inundated next. With this approach, the pixel with the largest \\(|\\Delta h|\\) has the highest probability of being inundated next, but other pixel also have a non-null probability of inundation. Path of steepest descent in Q-LavHA By default, Q-LavHA computes a relative probability across the 8 surrounding pixels using \\(\\Delta h^2\\) according to: \\[ P_i^2 = \\frac{(\\Delta h_i)^2}{\\sum_{j=1}^{8} (\\Delta h_i)^2}, i=1,2,\\ldots,8 \\] If potential topographic obstacles are not overcome by the application of \\(H_c\\) and \\(H_p\\) around the 8 surrounding pixels, Q-LavHA extends its search to the next 16 surrounding pixels. Q-LavHA then transforms these relative probabilities into a cumulative probability function \\(S_i\\) : \\[ S_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{i} P_j, i=1,2,\\ldots,8 \\] A random number \\(rnd\\) is then drawn in the \\([0, 1[\\) interval, and used to select the corresponding pixel in the range \\([S_{i-1}, Si[\\) : \\[ S_{i-1} \\leq rnd \\leq S_i, i=1,2,\\ldots,8 \\] Figure 1: Topographic corrections applied in `Q-LavHA`. Flow length Flow length is a critical metrics of lava flow hazard. However, since it depends on a complex interaction between eruption conditions at the source, flow rheology and topography through time and space, modelling the case-per-case physics of each flow is unrealistic in hazard assessment contexts. For this reason, Q-LavHA proposes three alternatives to compute maximum flow length: A maximum user defined length, using either Euclidean or Manhattan distances. A decreasing probability function based on existing flow databases. The cooling-limited flow model FLOWGO 2 . Lava flow distance As you can see from the geological map of La Palma , most historical flows on the island have reached the sea, so we will consider here that the flow distance is of limited importance. This assumption is however invalid in most cases. The probability function option allows you define a probability of flow length based on a mean and standard deviation of known lava flows length, which is a convenient way to treat this parameter probabilistically. Refer to the original paper 1 for more information. Probability of flow inundation As previously seen , probability of lava flow inundation \\(P\\) at a given pixel \\(x, y\\) is generally computed as the number of inundation counts \\(n_i\\) normalised by the number of runs \\(N_r\\) : \\[ P(x,y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{r}}n_{i}}{N_{r}} \\] Where \\(N_{r}\\) is the total number of runs and \\(n_{i}\\) is defined as: \\[ n_{i} = \\bigg\\{ ^{1,\\ if\\ inundation} _{0,\\ otherwise} \\] Depending on the modeling options adopted, Q-LavHA will slightly modify this approach. Refer to the original paper 1 for more information. Exercise Install Q-LavHA Start by making sure that Q-LavHA has been properly installed according to this guide . You should see this icon in the toolbar. In the Lava Flow exercise layer group in QGIS , activate the Vents Exercise layer. Running Q-LavHA for single vents These vents correspond to those indicated in the Table below. Q-LavHA requires projected UTM coordinates , which are shown in the Easting and Northing columns ( x and y columns, respectively). The UTM zone for La Palma is 28N , or EPSG:3268 . Vent Latitude Longitude Easting (m) Northing (m) EPSG Vent 1 -17.83989 28.62507 222340 3169746 32628 Vent 2 -17.86626 28.61262 219728 3168426 32628 Vent 3 -17.84316 28.58782 221922 3165623 32628 Vent 4 -17.81585 28.60777 224646 3167772 32628 Vent 5 -17.84649 28.49699 221357 3155562 32628 Coordinate systems Here, you are provided with input data that all have the same coordinate system . Before modeling lava flows for your own projects, make sure that you first reproject all your data to a unique CRS . Model setup Let's run Q-LavHA for each of the vents defined above. For now, we will assume that we know exactly the vent location. Open the Q-LavHA window, and let's look at the parameters: Vent location tab Lava flow parameter tab Output files tab In the DEM Selection box, select the Data/Lava/DEM_Qlavah.tif . In the DEM selection window, make sure you change the type of files from .asc to .tif . As a Vent Type , choose Point for now. Add the relevant Coordinates . Lava Flow Propagation : This section sets up the behaviour of the lava flow, as described in the theory section. Leave the default values of Hc and Ht . Use the H16 option: This means that the algorithm will first search for a topographic low within the first 8 adjacent pixels, and will extend the search to the next 16 ones if not found. Use Probability to the square Lava Flow Length Constrain : This section defines when a lava flow stops. You can switch between the various options for an illustration of the different behaviours. As discussed above, use a Manhattan Distance with a length of 10000 m . Simulations : Use a Number of iterations of 1500. This represents the number of simulated lava flows, or \\(N_r\\) in the equations above. Set an Output path and a name to the output layers. Save the Parameters . You are now ready to run the simulation! Vent geometry Q-LavHA offers different source geometries, such as a fissure, or a vent opening susceptibility map. The choice of these options depends on the case study, and their use is described in the Q-LavHA user manual . Styling outputs Upon completion of the model run, the output file is directly added to the layer panel. Let's change its visualisation: Open the Layer Properties panel by double-clicking on the output layer in the Layers panel. From the Symbology tab on the left: Under Color Rendering , uncheck the Colorize option. Under Render type , choose Singleband pseudocolor . Set the min and max values to 0 and 0.5, respectively. Change the Color ramp to Magma Click ok. The output file now shows the spatial distribution of inundation probability varying between \\(\\gt 0\\) and \\(0.5\\) (i.e., 50%). Copying layer symbology In QGIS , you can simply copy the display properties of one layer to other layers: In the Layers panel, right-click on the layer you want to copy the style from and select Styles > Copy style . Now right-click on the layer you want to apply to style on and select Styles > Paste style . Analysing results Following this procedure, run Q-LavHA for all the vents specified in the Table above and apply the same symbology. Answer the following questions: Question 1: Single-vent simulations How do modelled flows compare to historical lava flows in terms of length and width? Analyse and discuss the spatial distribution of inundation probability. How do they compare to flow accumulation rasters and the path of steepest descent approach? Where do branching occur? Chose one vent for which you will produce another run with the same parameters as above. Are they exactly the same? If not, why? Compare simulations from vent 2 with the flow outlines of the 2021 eruption. When and where is the model doing a good job? When and where is it not? Why? Using several vents Even in monogenetic vents , one eruptive episode can consist of multiple satellite vents. This was certainly the case for the 2021 eruption of La Palma. In fact, as you can see from the 2021 Vents layer in QGIS , CEMS identified that ~10 vents opened over a 500 x 500 m area. Here, we won't attempt predicting the number or the location of each vent; instead, we will model lava flow inundation from a grid of vents within a surface area and explore how vent location affects the lava flow simulation hazard. (Not) one vent to rule them all You've each been assigned one of the vents defined in the table above. Since this step takes more computational time, please run this procedure only for this vent. Define the area We will define a potential vent opening surface as a 500 x 500 m square centered on the reference coordinates of your attributed vent. Note that UTM coordinates are in meter : you can therefore simply identify the x and y coordinates these four points by addition and subtraction: Lower left corner Lower right corner Upper right corner Upper left corner Model setup From QGIS open Q-LavHA . Most of the parameters should already be filled. Otherwise, you can use the Load parameters option. Set a Distance between vents of 100 m. Since we definerd a 500 x 500 m area, Q-LavHA will therefore model lava flow inundation from 25 vents. Enter the 4 coordinates previously defined. In the Lava Flow Parameter tab, change the Number of Simulations to 100 . This will help save some computation time. Make sure you change the output name. Run the model! Analysing results Apply the same methodology to the surface area runs as you did for the point run. Question 2: Vent location uncertainty Compare the run with its single-vent counterpart. How do they differ and why? Prepare your hazard maps The raw geotiff files produced by Q-LavHA are your main hazard files. If you choose to work in QGIS you can further export them to maps using the Print Layout tool (\u2192 doc & tutorial ). Food for thoughts Forecasting the flows from the 2021 eruption Compare the Q-LavHA run with the flow outlines from the 2021 eruption below. Note that the Q-LavHA run was performed using the same 500 x 500 m source area as used above. Q-LavHA runs Flow outlines Question 3: Interpreting hazard forecasts From what you know about both the 2021 eruption and the dynamics of lava flows, compare and discuss the hazard forecast and the actual deposit. What are Q-LavHA 's strengths and limitations? Summary In this exercise, you have: Understood the philosophy behind a probabilistic model for lava flow inundation, Q-LavHA . Assessed the hazard of lava flow inundation using probabilistic modeling. Included the uncertainty on vent location in hazard estimates. Understood the limitations of model predictions when compared to past events. References Mossoux, S., Saey, M., Bartolini, S., Poppe, S., Canters, F., Kervyn, M., 2016.

Over the past years, volcanic crises in Hawaii in 2018, in DRC and La Palma in 2021 have demonstrated the difficulty in managing these long\u2013lasting crises. This is due to the fact that lava flows are governed by complex rheological processes, making their paths hard to predict. As a result, forecasts are often associated with large uncertainties that makes them unusable during crisis management. Does this mean that we are helpless in reducing the risk associated with lava flows? Well, no, not entirely. In this exercise, we will differentiate between various purposes of hazard (and risk!) assessments for different parts of the risk cycle , contrasting between actions taken long before the event during the prevention phase - where the idea here is to plan ahead to reduce the risk - and actions taken short before or during the event in the preparedness and response phases - where the aim is to minimise immediate impacts. We will discuss these concepts throughout the exercise and in the field, but refer to the ADVISE 1 approach for an overview of the risk framework we are applying here. Exercise outline In this exercise, we will look at two complementary approaches to assess the hazard associated with lava flow inundation that are the path of steepest descent and the Q-LavHA model. Path of steepest descent Firstly, we will have a look at how simple hydrological tools can help us estimate the direction of lava flows. The path of steepest descent approach, which estimates flow direction based only on the hydrological properties of the terrain. Despite its simplicity, this is the preferred method used by USGS and Hawaii Volcano Observatory (HVO) to communicate with stakeholders during lava flow crises. Q-LavHA Secondly, we will test the Q-LavHA model, which goes one step forward in attempting to predict lava flow inundation using some stochastic strategies to estimate the uncertainty associated with lava flow emplacement processes. Objectives With this exercise, using two types of approaches to estimate the hazard associated with lava flow inundation, you will: Compare deterministic and probabilistic approaches. Understand the value of uncertainty quantification and its role in risk communication. Appreciate the difference between short-term hazard communication during crises and long-term hazard assessment for risk mitigation. Communicating uncertainties during lava flow crises Since the beginning of the Pu\u2018u\u2018\u014d\u2018\u014d eruption in 1983 to its end in 2018 , the Big Island of Hawaii has been periodically affected by lava flow crises. These repeated crises have provided important lessons on how to communicate hazard uncertainties during crises. During the 2014 crisis, the flow field was dangerously heading towards the town of P\u0101hoa. Under pressure from decision makers, HVO attempted to provide a forecast and estimated that the flow might reach the town of P\u0101hoa within a few to tens of days... only that the media only reported the \"a few\" days, creating panic amongst the community. HVO realised the difficulty in communicating such a large uncertainty in operational activities and decided to cease providing forecasts. Instead, they reverted back to the steepest descent method which, although over-simplifying complex flow-emplacement processes, has the benefit of being transparent. In addition, HVO conducted meetings with stakeholders, agencies and the public, where they explained the limitations encountered when modeling lava flows. This combination of the use of a simplistic model with outreach events proved out to be the most efficient communication procedure and contributed to both increasing the trust in HVO and efficiently reducing the risk 2 3 .

Assessing the timing of lava inundation is still an active topic of research, so we will restrict ourselves to estimating the surface area of flows. For this, we first need to review some of the physical concepts behind the fluid dynamics of lava flows. Objectives Understand basic rheological properties of lavas. Review the main emplacement processes. Identify and appreciate the sources of uncertainties in lava flow modelling. When and why do lavas flow? Credits This section is largely inspired by the great rheology class of Tom Shea at the University of Hawai'i. Some definitions Shear stress The shear stress \\(\\tau\\) is the load stress applied to a fluid \u2192 i.e., the force per unit area acting in the direction and parallel to the flow surface: \\[ \\tau = \\rho g h \\times sin(\\alpha)\\ [Pa = Nm^{-2}] \\] Strain rate The strain rate \\(\\epsilon\\) is the rate of deformation when a shear stress is applied \u2192 i.e., velocity gradient: \\[ \\epsilon = \\frac{dV}{dZ}\\ [s^{-1}] \\] Yield strength The yield strength \\(\\tau _0\\) is the shear stress above which deformation begins : \\[ \\tau_0 = \\rho g h_0 \\times sin(\\alpha)\\ [Pa = Nm^{-2}] \\] Viscosity The viscosity \\(\\eta\\) is the resistance of fluid to flow when shear stress is applied: \\[ \\eta = \\frac{d\\tau}{d\\epsilon}\\ [Pa\\ s = Nm^{-2}s] \\] When does lava flow?

Flow rheology Newtonian fluids Newtonian fluids will start to flow/deform when an infinitesimally low shear stress is applied The relationship between the applied force (\u2192 shear stress ) and rate of deformation (\u2192 strain rate ) is linear Non-newtonian fluid A fluid is non-newtonian when one of these conditions is met: The relationship between shear stress and strain rate is non-linear A yield strength must be exceeded before flowing occurs, after which the shear stress / strain rate relationship can be linear or not Amongst non-newtonian fluids: Fluids with variable shear stress / strain rate include pseudoplastic or dilatant fluids Dilatant fluids: apparent viscosity increases with increasing shear rate \u2192 shear thickening fluids Pseudoplastic fluids: apparent viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate \u2192 shear thinning fluids Bingham fluids are a special type of non-newtonian fluids characterized by a yield strength and a linear shear stress / strain rate relationship Lava flows Lava flows are typically non-newtonian , pseudoplastic fluids with a yield strength . Think of a slope. If you drop a newtonian fluid (i.e., no yield strength) on it, it will immediately start flowing, whereas non-newtonian fluids with a yield strength will require some help. Can you think of any fluids that would behave like these? Solution Water is a newtonian fluid with no yield strength Toothpaste is a non-newtonian fluids with a yield strength What parameters can help lava flows to overcome yield strength? Solution Effusion rate Flow thickness Slope Dynamics of lava flows Let's try and put these physical concepts in the perspective of actual lava flows. Look at these videos, and describe them in terms of: Flow shape, geometry, morphology, texture Colour (as an indicator to which physical parameter?) Velocity and flow rate? Flow type Video 1 Video 2 Lava channel Video 1a Video 1b P\u0101hoehoe Video 2a Video 2b 'A'\u0101 Video 3a Video 3b Lava flows properties What do you see? From the parameters described above, what can you infer on the underlying processes? How would you describe the advance rates of each lava flow type? What distance from the vent is each flow? Where do you think the local effusion rate is the highest? Physical modelling as a hazard tool These videos illustrate the variety and the complexity of processes controlling the spatio-temporal evolution of lava flows. Attempting to sum up all processes taking place in lava flow emplacement is difficult, but here are some of the higher-level parameters 1 2 3 4 : Advance rate : Volumetric effusion rate Proximity to the vent Flow length : Eruption rate (both magnitude and steadiness) Slope traversed Extent of topographic confinement Initial lava temperature and rheological properties Emplacement conditions (open channel or insulating tube) No model is yet able to capture the ensemble of these parameters, and therefore each model relies on different assumptions 5 . For instance, the FLOWGO model 6 describes the physics behind the down-flow evolution of thermal and rheological properties of lava flows, but assumes a channel-contained lava flow. Other models, such as Q-LavHA 7 or MrLavaLoba 8 bypass the use of physics and describe the emplacement of lava flows as stochastic processes. Understanding both i) the issues behind the studied problem (e.g., process-driven research vs hazard assessment) and ii) the limitations behind numerical models is key to identify and adopt the appropriate modelling approach. Modeling natural phenomena Don't forget what the statistician George Box wrote in his 1987 book Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces : Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful. The 2016 eruption of Pu\u2018u \u2018\u014c\u2018\u014d As already discussed, the combination of all these parameters make lava flow modeling a complex problem associated with large uncertainties . One critical aspect of risk management is that these lava flow crises are often long-lasting , and predicting their spatio-temporal evolution is currently impossible beyond a time window of a few hours to days. This is especially true for p\u0101hoehoe flow fields , where random processes are important 1 . Let's use some downward counterfactual thinking on the 2016 lava flow of Pu\u2018u \u2018\u014c\u2018\u014d in Hawai'i to appreciate the complexity of predicting the evolution of such an event. Fortunately, this event did not affect any settlements. Here is a summary of the chronology: Date Observation May 24 Onset of summit eruption at Pu\u2018u \u2018\u014c\u2018\u014d June 08 Development of a compound lava flow going SE June 08-28 Lava flow emplacement as p\u0101hoehoe June 28-30 Lava reached the pali, transition to 'A'\u0101 June 30 Onset of development of compound p\u0101hoehoe on coastal plain July 26 Ocean entry, 11 km away from source Until sept Widening of the flow field Hawaii 2016 flow Toes Lava tube Morphology transition Figure 2: Overview of the Big Island of Hawai'i. Figure 3: Map of the 61g flow. Figure 4: Early emplacement of a new p\u0101hoehoe flow as \"toes\" (Picture: S. Biass). Figure 5: Lava tube developed in a mature p\u0101hoehoe field (Picture: S. Biass). Figure 6: View of the Pali (meaning \"cliff\" in Hawaiian). At the top, the flow is p\u0101hoehoe, but transitions to 'A'\u0101/open channel on higher slopes. At the bottom of the Pali, the flow reverts back to p\u0101hoehoe (Picture: S. Biass). Evolution of the flow field The evolution of the p\u0101hoehoe flow field was studied during the eruption using structure-from-motion from helicopter 9 , from which 3D maps of topographic and thermal features were created. These maps capture the spatio-temporal evolution of the dynamics of lava flow emplacement and highlight the difficulty in predicting the ensemble of controlling processes. Topographic evolution Thermal evolution Steepest descent Figure 7 illustrates how compound p\u0101hoehoe lava flows alter the topography, which affects the emplacement of subsequent flow units. Figure 7: Elevation changes calculated as the difference with the pre-flow DEM 9 . Figure 8 shows the thermal evolution of the surface of compound p\u0101hoehoe lava flows. The initial, uniformly high surface temperature gradually decreases, which reflects the thermal insulation of the flow and the development of lava tubes. Lava tubes efficiently transport lava from the source to the front with little cooling, and drives the down-flow surface breakouts observed on 08/19. Figure 8: Thermal evolution of the flow's surface 9 . Figure 9 shows the evolution of the prediction efficiency of the path of steepest descent approach as a consequence of the evolution of the DEM and the development of a tube system. Figure 9: Evolution of the stream network and comparison to the flow outlines and tube system 9 . Conclusion Fundamental processes governing lava flow emplacement are numerous and complicated by feedbacks and non-linear interactions occurring at various temporal and spatial scales. The development of predictive models are impeded by two sources of uncertainties: On the one hand, either the full range of parameters to accurately describe emplacement processes are rarely available (e.g., channelised flows) or physical models do not exist (e.g., p\u0101hoehoe flows); this can be referred to as an epistemic uncertainty; On the other hand, stochastic rather than physical processes dominate the emplacement dynamics (e.g., p\u0101hoehoe flows); this can be referred to as an aleatoric uncertainty. This limited ability to predict the evolution of lava flow crises result in high uncertainties during the management of long-lasting lava flow crises. In this context, lava flow hazard assessments should always be achieved with: The understanding of the limitations of each models and their sources of uncertainties ; A framework to quantify and communicate uncertainties, which is out next topic. Summary Lava flows are non-newtonian fluids with a yield strength . Their emplacement is controlled by source conditions , topographic control and rheological properties . No unified model for flow emplacement exists, and modelling approaches follow two main directions: physical and stochastic strategies. References Harris, A.J.L., Rowland, S.K., 2015.

Where do you think the local effusion rate is the highest?","title":" Dynamics of lava flows"},{"location":"Hazard_lava_modeling/#physical-modelling-as-a-hazard-tool","text":"These videos illustrate the variety and the complexity of processes controlling the spatio-temporal evolution of lava flows. Attempting to sum up all processes taking place in lava flow emplacement is difficult, but here are some of the higher-level parameters 1 2 3 4 : Advance rate : Volumetric effusion rate Proximity to the vent Flow length : Eruption rate (both magnitude and steadiness) Slope traversed Extent of topographic confinement Initial lava temperature and rheological properties Emplacement conditions (open channel or insulating tube) No model is yet able to capture the ensemble of these parameters, and therefore each model relies on different assumptions 5 . For instance, the FLOWGO model 6 describes the physics behind the down-flow evolution of thermal and rheological properties of lava flows, but assumes a channel-contained lava flow. Other models, such as Q-LavHA 7 or MrLavaLoba 8 bypass the use of physics and describe the emplacement of lava flows as stochastic processes. Understanding both i) the issues behind the studied problem (e.g., process-driven research vs hazard assessment) and ii) the limitations behind numerical models is key to identify and adopt the appropriate modelling approach. Modeling natural phenomena Don't forget what the statistician George Box wrote in his 1987 book Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces : Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful.","title":"Physical modelling as a hazard tool"},{"location":"Hazard_lava_modeling/#the-2016-eruption-of-puu-oo","text":"As already discussed, the combination of all these parameters make lava flow modeling a complex problem associated with large uncertainties . One critical aspect of risk management is that these lava flow crises are often long-lasting , and predicting their spatio-temporal evolution is currently impossible beyond a time window of a few hours to days. This is especially true for p\u0101hoehoe flow fields , where random processes are important 1 . Let's use some downward counterfactual thinking on the 2016 lava flow of Pu\u2018u \u2018\u014c\u2018\u014d in Hawai'i to appreciate the complexity of predicting the evolution of such an event. Fortunately, this event did not affect any settlements. Here is a summary of the chronology: Date Observation May 24 Onset of summit eruption at Pu\u2018u \u2018\u014c\u2018\u014d June 08 Development of a compound lava flow going SE June 08-28 Lava flow emplacement as p\u0101hoehoe June 28-30 Lava reached the pali, transition to 'A'\u0101 June 30 Onset of development of compound p\u0101hoehoe on coastal plain July 26 Ocean entry, 11 km away from source Until sept Widening of the flow field Hawaii 2016 flow Toes Lava tube Morphology transition Figure 2: Overview of the Big Island of Hawai'i.

These maps capture the spatio-temporal evolution of the dynamics of lava flow emplacement and highlight the difficulty in predicting the ensemble of controlling processes. Topographic evolution Thermal evolution Steepest descent Figure 7 illustrates how compound p\u0101hoehoe lava flows alter the topography, which affects the emplacement of subsequent flow units. Figure 7: Elevation changes calculated as the difference with the pre-flow DEM 9 . Figure 8 shows the thermal evolution of the surface of compound p\u0101hoehoe lava flows. The initial, uniformly high surface temperature gradually decreases, which reflects the thermal insulation of the flow and the development of lava tubes. Lava tubes efficiently transport lava from the source to the front with little cooling, and drives the down-flow surface breakouts observed on 08/19. Figure 8: Thermal evolution of the flow's surface 9 . Figure 9 shows the evolution of the prediction efficiency of the path of steepest descent approach as a consequence of the evolution of the DEM and the development of a tube system.

The development of predictive models are impeded by two sources of uncertainties: On the one hand, either the full range of parameters to accurately describe emplacement processes are rarely available (e.g., channelised flows) or physical models do not exist (e.g., p\u0101hoehoe flows); this can be referred to as an epistemic uncertainty; On the other hand, stochastic rather than physical processes dominate the emplacement dynamics (e.g., p\u0101hoehoe flows); this can be referred to as an aleatoric uncertainty. This limited ability to predict the evolution of lava flow crises result in high uncertainties during the management of long-lasting lava flow crises. In this context, lava flow hazard assessments should always be achieved with: The understanding of the limitations of each models and their sources of uncertainties ; A framework to quantify and communicate uncertainties, which is out next topic.","title":" Conclusion"},{"location":"Hazard_lava_modeling/#summary","text":"Lava flows are non-newtonian fluids with a yield strength .

DEM are raster datasets containing an elevation value at each pixel, which capture the morphology of the Earth's surface. Global DEM datasets such as SRTM or ASTER are usually produced from the ISS or satellite imagery, but higher-definition datasets can be produced from airborne LiDAR missions or structure-from-motion from UAVs . Here, we will use a DEM with a resolution of 25 m covering the island of La Palma created by the Cartogr\u00e1fica de Canarias, GRAFCAN (updated the 4 February 2021, available at https://opendata.sitcan.es/). Using only a DEM , hydrological analyses can help establishing a surface water system model that we can use to constrain some surface hydrological processes, including likely flow direction or drainage basins . It is therefore extensively used in land-use planning to estimate potentially flooding areas, or to design proposed drainage systems and facilities. Since lava flows are confined by topography, flow paths can be broadly predicted from DEM once the vent location is identified. Here, we will use this workflow to get a general idea of the possible lava flow paths in La Palma: flowchart LR A[Flow accumulation] --> B[Stream network] B --> C[Drainage basins] Several softwares propose implementations of hydrological analyses including QGIS , Matlab and ArcGIS .

Objectives Understand the value of DEM datasets to extract a surface water runoff model. Explore the use of hydrological analyses for lava flow hazard assessment. Understand the benefits and limitations of this approach. Theory Flow accumulation Start by showing only the Flow Accumulation (log) layer in QGIS . Conceptually, the Flow Accumulation raster represents the cumulative number of upstream pixels that contribute to surface water drainage to any given downstream pixel . Starting from a DEM , the algorithm: Assumes that water at a given pixel will flow towards the adjacent pixel that shows the greatest \\(-\\Delta z\\) to estimate the flow directions. Once flow direction is estimated, the algorithm counts how many upstream pixels contribute to any given downstream pixel. Do it yourself! Starting from this DEM , can you estimate the most likely flow direction and the flow accumulation values? Flow accumulation Pink lines show flow direction . The blue gradient shows flow accumulation \u2192 darker shades of blue indicate the contribution from more pixels . Look at the Flow Accumulation (log) layer in QGIS . For a better visual rendering, this layer shows the log10 of the number of contributing pixels. Analyse the dataset in perspective of the underlying DEM . Does it make sense? (Spoiler alert: it does!) Stream network Now turn on the Stream network layer in QGIS . Stream network algorithm simply applies a threshold of count values \\(c\\) to the Flow Accumulation raster to delineate a stream . If a given pixel has a number of contributing pixels \\(C\\) such as \\(C \\geq c\\) , then the pixel is assumed to be part of the stream. Think of the Stream network information as a higher-level version of the Flow Accumulation raster. As a matter of fact, Stream network is another word for path of steepest descent . Stream network From the same DEM as before, this is how the path of steepest descent would look: Threshold value Note that there is no universal value for \\(c\\) : it depends on such aspects as the maturity of the drainage system, the scale of the analysis or the resolution of the DEM . It should therefore be explored on a case-per-case basis. Drainage basin Turn on the Drainage basin layer in QGIS : this raster now classifies which stream each pixel contributes to . Think of it as a watershed , where ridges act as limits between zone contributing to different streams and valleys accumulate most of the surface flow. Validate that by observing the Drainage basin layer in perspective of the underlying topography. Drainage basin It is now possible to estimate where water on each pixel will go. Question 1: Drainage system You can observe a large discrepancy in the area and the shape of the various drainage basins. How do they spatially vary over the island? How do they relate to the underlying topography? Exercise Historical lava flows Let's now place this data in the context of a hazard assessment. Start by downloading the geological map of La Palma by Carracedo et al., (2001) and spend some time looking at it. Question 2: Historical lava flows Can you spot where historical lava flows occurred? Are they originating from a single or multiple vents? In historical times, what part of the island has been most affected by lava flows? How do the directions of past flow match predictions from hydrological modeling? Monogenetic vs polygenetic volcanism La Palma is a composite volcano. As you can see both from the DEM and the geological map, the currently most active southern part contains several monogenetic vents. Monogenetic vents are typically active during a single eruptive event and not reactivated afterwards. The opening of a new vent is then controlled by several parameters (e.g., tectonic regime 1 ), and predicting the spatial likelihood of vent opening is an additional complexity for long-term hazard and risk assessments in monogenetic fields. This is especially the case for Auckland, which is built on a monogenetic field 2 . Here are some definitions of volcanic landforms 3 : Composite volcanoes All conical or broadly conical polygenetic volcanoes constructed of accumulations of lava and pyroclastic deposits, sometimes alternating, erupted from vent(s) located at the summit (eruptions can also on occasion occur from the flanks) of the volcano. Monogenetic vents Discrete minor volcanic landform that forms during one eruptive cycle. Can be mafic (cinder or scoria cones, maars, diatremes, tuff cones, tuff rings, and scutulum shields) or silicic (lava domes and coule es) in composition. Typical lifetimes of years to decades for mafic centers, decades to centuries for silicic ones. Polygenetic vents Large discrete volcanic landform that forms during several episodic eruptive cycles. Typical lifetimes of \\(10^4-10^5\\) years. Can be mafic or silicic in composition. Most common types are composite volcanoes and shield volcanoes. Probability of vent opening As we will discuss throughout the exercices, assessing where the next monogenetic vent will open is a difficult process. In their paper, Marrero et al. (2019) 4 , used a random model to represent the complexity of the spatial distribution of vent location that the monogenetic volcanic activity can produce. The resulting vents are shown in Figure 1. This is a discussable choice, and you are invited to refer to the original paper for their motivations. In any case, one assumption behind this approach is that all vents shown in Figure 1 have an equal probability of occurrence . Figure 1: Possible location of vent opening for the next eruption according to Marrero et al. (2019). Question 3: Vent opening If all vents in Figure 1 have an equal probability of occurrence , does that mean that the entire island is uniformly exposed to lava flow inundation? What parts of the island are most exposed to lava flow inundation? Are there any safe/shadow parts? The 2021 eruption The 2021 eruption of Cumbre Vieja started on September 19 and lasted until December. During this period, multiple vents opened, some producing tephra whilst other produced compound lava flows that reached the sea. In QGIS , the 2021 Eruption layer group shows you both the vents and the chronology of lava flows provided by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS). Identify feature tool By using the Identify Feature tool in the Toolbar , you can click on any lava flow outline and see its properties in the Identify results panel. Check the date field. Using the lava flow outlines, we computed the evolution of flow length and flow width through time as shown in Figure 2. Question 4: Evolution of the flow field Using the flow outlines in QGIS and Figure 2, estimate: How accurate would have been the steepest descent approach to forecast flow inundation of the 2021 eruption? How different is the actual flow compared to the drainage network? How dynamic is a months-long lava flow? Is it a single event or a compound pulsatory phenomena? What event do you think corresponds to the dashed red line in Figure 2? What happens before and after ? What are the advance and widening rates of the 2021 lava flow? Can you use it to estimate the advance and widening of possible lava flows from other vents? Figure 2: Advance and widening rates of the 2021 lava flow. Food for thoughts Comparing the path of steepest descent approach computed on the pre-2021 eruption topography with the actual outlines of the lava flows of the 2021 eruption shows how: The path of steepest descent captures the general trend of flow direction but The actual flow significantly diverted from this initial prediction. Limitations Spend some time thinking about the reasons behind this discrepancy, including: The rheological properties of the lava flows. Their duration, the properties of single vs compound lava flows and their evolution in time. Their relation with topography. From a crisis management perspective and reflecting back on the K\u012blauea crises , the path of steepest descent is a great communication tool for as long as: There is an active monitoring of the crisis as it evolves. There is a clear and trusting communication channel between the monitoring agencies and the stakeholders, thanks to which limitations and uncertainties associated with predictions can be clearly explained and discussed. However, its deterministic nature prevents its ability to systematically account for uncertainties. In a way, it only shows the most likely scenario rather than exploring a range of possible scenarios. Therefore, the path of steepest descent approach is not suited for long-term hazard and risk studies, which are required for such tasks as land-use planning and the pro-active development of other risk-reduction strategies. In the next exercise, we will use a stochastic model to address some of these shortcomings and test it on La Palma. Summary In this exercise, we: Used hydrological modeling tools to obtain a first-order estimate of the possible extent of lava flow inundation. Compared this approach with historical and recent lava flows at La Palma. Discussed its limitations and its domain of applicability.

We will never be able to predict exactly what will happen in the future, so we need to use a modeling framework that allows for uncertainty quantifications. This is where probabilistic modeling enters the show. Probabilistic modeling allows exploring a range of possible future outcomes rather than a a unique realisation. Objectives Introduction to probabilistic hazard modeling Application of a frequentist approach to lava flow inundation Probabilistic modelling Let's go back to the fictional DEM used in the previous exercise . As we saw from existing literature , monogenetic field such as the recent activity at La Palma imply that future eruptive event will take place from a new vent. Imagine that all the red pixels in Figure 1 represent coordinates where the next vent can potentially open. How do we account for the uncertainty associated with vent location when quantifying the hazard of a future eruption? Figure 1: Fictional DEM with locations of possible future vent opening indicated in red. The idea here is that we will not model only one realisation of an event - here one lava flow originating from a single location - but many , and that we will average all their contributions. Unlike what we saw when using the path of steepest descent , we will assess the flow trajectory initiating from all pixels in Figure 1. Figure 2: Combination of the paths of steepest descent estimated from all pixels of Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the overlay of the path of steepest descent computed from each of the 6 pixels identified in Figure 1. What do we see? Some pixels in Figure 2 are inundated regardless of the initialisation point (\u2192 darker shades of pink). Conversely, other pixels are inundated only for selected inundation points (\u2192 lighter shades of pink). Therefore, darker pixels have higher probabilities of inundation than others. Using a frequentist approach, we can calculate the probability \\(P(x,y)\\) of a pixel to be inundated by counting how many times a pixel is hit and normalising this count by the total number of runs, where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the pixel's coordinates: \\[ P(x,y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{r}}n_{i}}{N_{r}} \\] Where \\(N_{r}\\) is the total number of runs and \\(n_{i}\\) is defined as: \\[ n_{i} = \\bigg\\{ ^{1,\\ if\\ inundation} _{0,\\ otherwise} \\] Figure 3: Computing the probability of inundation using a frequentist approach. So, from Figures 2 and 3: A pixel hit once ( \\(n_{i} = 1\\) ) over the six simulations ( \\(N_{r} = 6\\) ) has a probability \\(P(x,y) = \\frac{1}{6} = 0.17\\) (or 17%). A pixel hit twice ( \\(n_{i} = 2\\) ) over the six simulations has a probability \\(P(x,y) = \\frac{2}{6} = 0.33\\) (or 33%).

As we saw from existing literature , monogenetic field such as the recent activity at La Palma imply that future eruptive event will take place from a new vent.

How do we account for the uncertainty associated with vent location when quantifying the hazard of a future eruption? Figure 1: Fictional DEM with locations of possible future vent opening indicated in red. The idea here is that we will not model only one realisation of an event - here one lava flow originating from a single location - but many , and that we will average all their contributions.

Objectives Understand how ESP can be translated into probabilistic eruption scenarios . Learn the mechanics of probabilistic hazard modelling for tephra accumulation. Review how to compute and display hazard outputs. Probabilistic hazard modelling For the sake of this exercise, let's consider a Plinian eruption from Cotopaxi volcano (Ecuador) that occurred ~1200 years ago. By using the workflow previously introduced, we were able to reconstruct the ESP of the eruption 1 . Deposit Maps Eruption classification Figure 1: Isopach ( a , contours of equal thickness) and isopleth ( b , contours of equal largest clasts) for the selected deposit of Cotopaxi volcano. Both maps are in \\(cm\\) . Figure 2: Eruption classification using deposit properties using the methods of a Bonadonna and Costa (2013) and b Pyle (1989). Based on this, we were able to estimate that 4.5 \\(\\times 10^8\\ m^3\\) of tephra were erupted from a 25 km-high plume over ~1h, and that the deposit indeed shows the characteristics of a Plinian eruption 2 3 . Based on the volume, this eruption had a VEI of 4. Great. We now have one reference eruption. But is that sufficient to be used as a representative hazard information for a future eruption of Cotopaxi volcano? The early days: deposit-based hazard maps For a long time, reference eruptions have been used as representative of the most likely future behaviour, in which case an isopach map such as Figure 1 was used as the hazard map for tephra accumulation. What do you think is missing?? Do you think that this approach represents a comprehensive representation of the possible hazard from future eruptions? Why, or why not? What do you think is missing? Spend some time thinking about these aspects in an intuitive way. Missing component #1 The Global Volcanism Program of the Smithsonian Institution is a useful database that attempts to compile the eruptive histories of volcanoes that have been active during the Holocene . Let's have a look at the eruptive history of Cotopaxi volcano inferred this database: What do we see? 78 eruptions are recorded in the catalogue. VEI vary between 1 and 5, which mean that during its history, eruptions at Cotopaxi volcano have had: Plume heights varying between 10's of meters to 10's of km. Erupted volumes varying between 10 \\(^{-5}\\) to 10 \\(^{1}\\) km \\(^{3}\\) . Lesson #1 Using a single isopach map implies that we are considering one realisation of the scope of eruptive behaviour that a given volcanic system is capable of exhibiting. Missing component #2 The tephra fallout hazard extends in the direction of the dominant wind patterns, which vary in time and space . Let's look at statistics of wind velocity and direction over the past 15 years at a given volcano: What do we see? Between the dry and the rainy seasons, the wind direction at this specific volcano can shift by 180 degrees . The rainy season is characterised by lower wind velocities. Lesson #2 Using a single isopach map implies that we are considering one realisation of the possible atmospheric patterns in which a future eruption could occur. As a summary, the previous lesson has provided us with a methodology to predict tephra accumulation , but we need to be able to account for the inherent variability of ESP when quantifying the associated hazard. Probabilistic eruption scenarios Probabilistic hazard modelling for tephra fallout follows the same general philosophy compared to what we adopted for lava flows with two notable differences. Model input \u2192 For lava flows , we used a non-physical model . As a consequence, we explored the uncertainty associated with vent location and the DEM rather than physical properties - or, in other words, ESP . Input parameters to Tephra2 are, however, physical ESP , and the aim of the probabilistic modelling approach for the tephra hazard will be to explore a range of possible eruption conditions for a future event. Model output \u2192 For lava flows , the output of one single run consisted of a boolean inundation/no inundation condition, and the probabilistic approach quantified a likelihood of pixel inundation by a lava flow. Conversely, the output of a single Tephra2 run is a hazard intensity , namely a mass accumulation per surface area ( \\(kg/m^2\\) ). The probabilistic approach will therefore help us to quantify a likelihood of a mass at a given pixel to exceed a specific threshold of mass accumulation . This flowchart illustrates the differences between these approaches: flowchart LR subgraph B[Deterministic tephra modeling] direction LR B1[Tephra2] --> B2[Mass accumulation M at pixel x,y] end subgraph A[Deterministic lava flow modeling] direction LR A1[Lava Flow model] --> A2[Yes/No inundation at pixel x,y] end A --> A0[[Probabilistic]]--> A3[\"P(inundation at pixel x,y)\"] B --> B0[[Probabilistic]]--> B3[\"P(mass at pixel x,y \u2265 threshold)\"] Identify ESP ranges The first step for the probabilistic hazard assessment of tephra fallout is to define an eruption scenario . An eruption scenario represents what we expect to be a possible future eruption behaviour based on our knowledge of the volcanic system. Concretely, an eruption scenario is defined by a spectrum of possible values that each ESP could exhibit during a future eruption. Probabilistic modeling requires to define ESPs not as single but as distributions of values, generally defined as: A range of values (i.e., the minimum and maximum values to explore). A shape of distribution. Let's go back to the Cotopaxi eruption presented above. The plume height estimated from the study of the deposit is 25 km . Based on our knowledge , we might postulate that a plume height of 25 km is indeed likely for a future eruption but want to acknowledge that our level of uncertainty may allow the plume height to vary between 20-30 km. In this case, we might adopt a normal distribution as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3: Starting from a deterministic (i.e., reference eruption) approach (left), an eruption scenario is defined by i) identifying a range (center) and a distribution (right) for each ESP. We need to repeat this process for all ESP relevant for the model used. For Tephra2 , we will focus here on Plume height and mass/volume . The how and why of eruption scenarios There is no magic answer on how to define eruption scenarios. This depends on a case-per-case basis and is often constrained by such aspects as the knowledge of the volcanic system and/or the purpose of the hazard analysis. Definition Ranges of ESP of a given eruption scenario can be tailored to reflect: A VEI An eruptive style An intensity A reference eruption Purpose The way an eruption scenario is defined can also reflect the purpose of the study. For instance, a long-term hazard study designed for preparedness might rely on eruption scenarios that consider wide ranges of EPS and focuses on epistemic uncertainties. Conversely, a hazard assessment required for emergency management during a crises might be informed by monitoring, and the associated scenario might be defined by narrower ranges of ESP that dominantly focus on the aleatory error. A note on the uncertainty of ESPs Choosing the most appropriate range and distribution for each ESP is not trivial and express the uncertainty that we have of what the next eruption will be. We have briefly discussed this at the end of this module , but let's review again what uncertainties are and where they are originating from. Conceptually, uncertainties can be classified in two categories: Uncertainties Epistemic uncertainty derives from the lack of knowledge regarding a phenomena. In theory, we could reduce epistemic uncertainties if more observations of the phenomena were available to help us better constrain the underlying processes and behaviours. Aleatoric uncertainty is associated with the inherent randomness of natural processes. Nothing much we can do about it, really! Figure 4 illustrates four different distributions that have been used in the literature to express ESP variability. These distributions combine both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. Although a better characterisation of the epistemic uncertainty would help to refine the top left distribution towards a distribution centered on a best guess values, the constant presence of an aleatoric component of uncertainty is the reason why the bottom right distribution is impossible to achieve. Probability distributions for ESP Figure 4: Illustration of various probability distributions used for EPS sampling The top left example is a uniform distribution: In this case, any value between min and max has an equal probability of occurrence . This is often referred to as a maximum level of ignorance . The top right example is a normal distribution: Here we assume that a central value has the highest probability of occurrence, but it can divert from it in a symmetrical fashion. The bottom left example is a logarithmic distribution: In this case, we assume that smaller values have higher probabilities of occurrence than larger ones. For instance, large earthquakes occur more often than small ones. Finally, the bottom right example represent an unrealistic case where min = max . This would only occur if there was no uncertainty . The critical objective here is to attempt to translate our knowledge of the volcanic system into realistic eruption scenarios . But how do we improve our knowledge and therefore reduce epistemic uncertainties around ESPs? Pragmatically, there are three main directions to do so: Field studies \u2192 Ideally, identifying the range of ESPs is based on extensive field studies . By reconstructing the stratigraphy of a volcanic edifice, we can study its past eruptive history , which is then used to estimate the potential future eruption scenarios . Literature review \u2192 This personal knowledge is then usually complemented by published literature . Analogues \u2192 However, for volcanoes with a poor geological record, it is often necessary to extend our knowledge based on analogue volcanoes or eruptions. Despite the development of dedicated methodologies 4 , this largely remains a subjective process. This step often relies on global eruption databases such as GVP 5 or LaMEVE 6 . Eruption scenario for Cotopaxi volcano Let's go back to the Cotopaxi case and develop an eruption scenario based around this reference eruption. Based on the eruption from Cotopaxi, we defined a VEI -based eruption scenario assuming: Volume/mass constraints based on a VEI 4 eruption \u2192 0.1\u20131 \\(km^3\\) or 0.1\u20131 \\(\\times 10^{12}\\ kg\\) . Plume heights of 20\u201330 \\(km\\) . Wind conditions based on Reanalysis datasets. Note that for 1 and 2 , we adopt a normal distribution. In this way, we consider that the values obtained from the deposit characterisation are the most likely, but that diverging values also have non-null probabilities of occurrence (albeit less likely). Reanalysis datasets Reanalysis datasets are incredibly useful datasets providing gridded atmospheric conditions at consistent spatial and temporal resolutions for the past 5-7 decades. Initially developed to constrain the initial conditions for weather forecasts, we used them in probabilistic tephra modeling to estimate the most likely wind conditions at a given volcano. We typically download 10-20 years of wind, and these datasets provide one wind profile per either 1, 6, 12 or 24 hours. We rely on two main Reanalysis datasets: ERA5 from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the NCEP-DOE Reanalysis 2 . Probabilistic hazard modelling Now that we have defined the eruption scenario and associated ESPs, let's actually run the probabilistic hazard modeling. Similarly to the approach used for lava flows , we will perform a large number of single model runs. But instead of varying the vent location , each run be initiated with one set of ESP stochastically sampled from the pre-defined distributions. The cartoon below illustrates the process. We modeled \\(n\\) runs: here \\(n=3\\) , but we would typically used thousands of runs to ensure that ESP drawn from each distribution represents a statistically significant sample of the range of possible combinations and outcomes. Run 1 Run 2 Run n Computing hazard probabilities Let's compute probabilities for the following points: P1 , P2 and P3 . Across the 3 runs, P1 had accumulations of 0 \\(kg/m^2\\) for the first two simulations and 5 \\(kg/m^2\\) for the third one. P2 resulted in accumulations of 15, 12 and 2 \\(kg/m^2\\) over runs 1,2 and 3, respectively. P3 had accumulations of 7, 5 and 0 \\(kg/m^2\\) for runs 1,2 and 3, respectively. Let's now consider two tephra accumulation thresholds of 1 and 10 \\(kg/m^2\\) . We want to express how likely these accumulations are to occur over our set of runs. Let's take two examples: Across the 3 runs, an accumulation of 1 \\(kg/m^2\\) at P1 occurred in 1/3 cases: a future tephra accumulations at P1 therefore has a 33% probability to exceed a threshold of of 1 \\(kg/m^2\\) . At P2 , an accumulation of 10 \\(kg/m^2\\) occurred in 2/3 cases: a tephra accumulation of 10 \\(kg/m^2\\) therefore has a 66% probability of occurrence. By repeating this approach over all points of the map, it is now possible to represent the spatial distribution of hazard. What probabilities? Again, pay attention to what these probabilities express : In the case of lava flows , one single model run estimates a boolean yes/no inundation for each pixel, and the probabilistic approach quantifies a probability of flow inundation (\u2192 one single map). In the case of tephra deposits, one single model run estimates a continuous hazard intensity (i.e., mass of tephra per unit area). The probabilistic approach quantifies a probability of accumulation to exceed specific masses per unit area. Therefore, the output for probabilistic hazard assessment for tephra accumulation consists of multiple maps (\u2192 one map per accumulation threshold). Formalising probability computation We have defined an eruption scenario \\(E\\) , and we now want to compute the probability \\(P\\) of a given geographic point \\(x,y\\) to be subject to mass accumulations \\(M\\) exceeding a given accumulation threshold \\(M_T\\) : \\[ P[M(x,y) \\geqslant M_T \\mid E] \\] This probability \\(P\\) is computed using a simple frequentist approach: We simply divide the number of simulations that resulted in an accumulation exceeding the considered threshold (\u2192 \\(M(x,y) \\geqslant M_T\\) ) by the total number of runs: \\[ P(x,y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{r}}n_{i}}{N_{r}} \\] Where \\(N_{r}\\) is the total number of runs and \\(n_{i}\\) is defined as: \\[ n_{i} = \\bigg\\{ ^{1, if M(x,y) \\geqslant threshold \\mid run} _{0, otherwise} \\] Conditional probabilities The equations above highlight that the probability \\(P\\) is conditional to the occurrence of the eruption scenario . For now, we are only considering this question: What is the probability of a given geographic point to suffer tephra accumulations exceeding \\(x\\ kg/m^2\\) given that the eruption scenario E is occurring . Bear that in mind. We'll get back to this later. Hazard outputs We now have a framework to quantify hazard occurrence probabilistically, but how do we turn this information into a useful knowledge ? Let's look at the different methods available to display probabilistic hazard analyses. For tephra fallout, we have 4 quantities to represent that are: Latitude and longitude . Tephra accumulation . Probability of occurrence . However, it is difficult to represent more than 3 quantities on such a 2D canvas as a map, and we therefore need to fix one quantity , which provides us with 3 different approaches to express hazard. Method 1: Probabilistic hazard maps \u2192 Fixed threshold of tephra accumulation . \u2192 Other quantities are expressed continuously. \u2192 Display the spatial distribution of exceedence probabilities of a single threshold of tephra accumulation (i.e., there are as many maps as accumulation thresholds). Method 2: Probabilistic isomass maps \u2192 Fixed threshold of exceedence probability . \u2192 Other quantities are expressed continuously. \u2192 Display the spatial distribution of tephra accumulation for a single exceedence probability value (i.e., there are as many maps as probability values). Method 3: Hazard curves \u2192 Fixed latitude and longitude. \u2192 Other quantities are expressed continuously. \u2192 Display the probability of occurrence of a given tephra accumulation for a single location (i.e., there are as many curves as points of interest). Is the difference between probability and isomass maps are? Lets look at these sketches: Graphically... More formally... On the left, probabilistic hazard maps quantify the probability to exceed a mass accumulation. Contours show equal probabilities . On the right, probabilistic isomass maps show the mass accumulation occurring for a given probability. Contours show equal accumulations . Therefore, both maps show the same information but emphasise different quantities. Probabilistic hazard modelling estimates the tephra accumulations at a given pixel \\(x,y\\) for all of the \\(n\\) runs (here, \\(n=5\\) ). To produce probabilistic hazard maps , we adopt the frequentist approach previously described and calculate the probability to exceed a given mass accumulation \u2192 e.g., this pixel has a 3/5 = 60% probability of exceeding a tephra accumulation of 10 \\(kg/m^2\\) . To produce probabilistic isomass maps , we estimate the inverse of an empirical cumulative density function (i.e., the survivor function) using all modelled accumulations \u2192 e.g., the accumulation associated with a 25% exceedence probability is 36 \\(kg/m^2\\) . Rule of thumb Bear in mind: large tephra accumulations usually have lower probabilities of occurrence than smaller accumulations. Hazard output example Let's change volcanoes and continents: The examples below illustrate a hazard assessment for a VEI 4 Plinian eruption at Sakurajima volcano 7 in Japan, developed around the 1914 Taisho eruption 8 . Note that the hazard modeling procedure was exactly the same as for Cotopaxi. Probability maps Isomass maps Hazard curves These maps show the spatial probability to exceed accumulations of 1 (left) and 100 (right) \\(kg/m^2\\) . The top and bottom maps illustrate the impact of wind variability on the computed dispersal as a function of the season. The general dispersal is towards the E, but the summer shows a higher variability in directions and lower wind velocities, increasing the hazard on the city of Kagoshima (point number 3). These maps show the typical tephra accumulations for probabilities of occurrences of 25% (left) and 75% (right). Compared to probability maps, we can use the famous saying used in SE Asia: Same same, but different . This plot shows hazard curves computed for three different locations (see the maps for reference): Tarumizu City Hall Kagoshima airport Tarumizu central station Curves show a continuous relationship between tephra accumulation and their respective probabilities of occurrences. The advantage of hazard curves is that they can represent more than a single eruption scenario , which helps comparison. For instance, these plots contain the modelling of the VEI 4 eruption scenario using wind profiles for i) all seasons combined (solid line), the summer (dashed line) and spring, fall and winter (dotted line). To read these plots, start by identifying one tephra accumulation for which you want to estimate the associated probability of occurrence. From the plot's x axis, go straight up until the intersection with the curve representing the scenario of interest. From the point of intersection, go straight left and read the probability value on the y axis. For instance, the Tarumizu City Hall has a ~8% probability of exceeding accumulations of 100 \\(kg/m^2\\) following a VEI 4 eruption of Sakurajima volcano.

Let's look at statistics of wind velocity and direction over the past 15 years at a given volcano: What do we see? Between the dry and the rainy seasons, the wind direction at this specific volcano can shift by 180 degrees . The rainy season is characterised by lower wind velocities. Lesson #2 Using a single isopach map implies that we are considering one realisation of the possible atmospheric patterns in which a future eruption could occur. As a summary, the previous lesson has provided us with a methodology to predict tephra accumulation , but we need to be able to account for the inherent variability of ESP when quantifying the associated hazard.","title":"The early days: deposit-based hazard maps"},{"location":"Hazard_probabilistic2/#probabilistic-eruption-scenarios","text":"Probabilistic hazard modelling for tephra fallout follows the same general philosophy compared to what we adopted for lava flows with two notable differences. Model input \u2192 For lava flows , we used a non-physical model . As a consequence, we explored the uncertainty associated with vent location and the DEM rather than physical properties - or, in other words, ESP . Input parameters to Tephra2 are, however, physical ESP , and the aim of the probabilistic modelling approach for the tephra hazard will be to explore a range of possible eruption conditions for a future event. Model output \u2192 For lava flows , the output of one single run consisted of a boolean inundation/no inundation condition, and the probabilistic approach quantified a likelihood of pixel inundation by a lava flow. Conversely, the output of a single Tephra2 run is a hazard intensity , namely a mass accumulation per surface area ( \\(kg/m^2\\) ). The probabilistic approach will therefore help us to quantify a likelihood of a mass at a given pixel to exceed a specific threshold of mass accumulation .

An eruption scenario represents what we expect to be a possible future eruption behaviour based on our knowledge of the volcanic system. Concretely, an eruption scenario is defined by a spectrum of possible values that each ESP could exhibit during a future eruption. Probabilistic modeling requires to define ESPs not as single but as distributions of values, generally defined as: A range of values (i.e., the minimum and maximum values to explore). A shape of distribution. Let's go back to the Cotopaxi eruption presented above. The plume height estimated from the study of the deposit is 25 km . Based on our knowledge , we might postulate that a plume height of 25 km is indeed likely for a future eruption but want to acknowledge that our level of uncertainty may allow the plume height to vary between 20-30 km. In this case, we might adopt a normal distribution as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3: Starting from a deterministic (i.e., reference eruption) approach (left), an eruption scenario is defined by i) identifying a range (center) and a distribution (right) for each ESP. We need to repeat this process for all ESP relevant for the model used. For Tephra2 , we will focus here on Plume height and mass/volume . The how and why of eruption scenarios There is no magic answer on how to define eruption scenarios. This depends on a case-per-case basis and is often constrained by such aspects as the knowledge of the volcanic system and/or the purpose of the hazard analysis. Definition Ranges of ESP of a given eruption scenario can be tailored to reflect: A VEI An eruptive style An intensity A reference eruption Purpose The way an eruption scenario is defined can also reflect the purpose of the study. For instance, a long-term hazard study designed for preparedness might rely on eruption scenarios that consider wide ranges of EPS and focuses on epistemic uncertainties. Conversely, a hazard assessment required for emergency management during a crises might be informed by monitoring, and the associated scenario might be defined by narrower ranges of ESP that dominantly focus on the aleatory error.","title":"Identify ESP ranges"},{"location":"Hazard_probabilistic2/#a-note-on-the-uncertainty-of-esps","text":"Choosing the most appropriate range and distribution for each ESP is not trivial and express the uncertainty that we have of what the next eruption will be. We have briefly discussed this at the end of this module , but let's review again what uncertainties are and where they are originating from. Conceptually, uncertainties can be classified in two categories: Uncertainties Epistemic uncertainty derives from the lack of knowledge regarding a phenomena. In theory, we could reduce epistemic uncertainties if more observations of the phenomena were available to help us better constrain the underlying processes and behaviours. Aleatoric uncertainty is associated with the inherent randomness of natural processes. Nothing much we can do about it, really! Figure 4 illustrates four different distributions that have been used in the literature to express ESP variability. These distributions combine both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. Although a better characterisation of the epistemic uncertainty would help to refine the top left distribution towards a distribution centered on a best guess values, the constant presence of an aleatoric component of uncertainty is the reason why the bottom right distribution is impossible to achieve. Probability distributions for ESP Figure 4: Illustration of various probability distributions used for EPS sampling The top left example is a uniform distribution: In this case, any value between min and max has an equal probability of occurrence . This is often referred to as a maximum level of ignorance . The top right example is a normal distribution: Here we assume that a central value has the highest probability of occurrence, but it can divert from it in a symmetrical fashion. The bottom left example is a logarithmic distribution: In this case, we assume that smaller values have higher probabilities of occurrence than larger ones. For instance, large earthquakes occur more often than small ones. Finally, the bottom right example represent an unrealistic case where min = max . This would only occur if there was no uncertainty . The critical objective here is to attempt to translate our knowledge of the volcanic system into realistic eruption scenarios . But how do we improve our knowledge and therefore reduce epistemic uncertainties around ESPs? Pragmatically, there are three main directions to do so: Field studies \u2192 Ideally, identifying the range of ESPs is based on extensive field studies . By reconstructing the stratigraphy of a volcanic edifice, we can study its past eruptive history , which is then used to estimate the potential future eruption scenarios . Literature review \u2192 This personal knowledge is then usually complemented by published literature . Analogues \u2192 However, for volcanoes with a poor geological record, it is often necessary to extend our knowledge based on analogue volcanoes or eruptions. Despite the development of dedicated methodologies 4 , this largely remains a subjective process. This step often relies on global eruption databases such as GVP 5 or LaMEVE 6 .","title":"A note on the uncertainty of ESPs"},{"location":"Hazard_probabilistic2/#eruption-scenario-for-cotopaxi-volcano","text":"Let's go back to the Cotopaxi case and develop an eruption scenario based around this reference eruption.

Reanalysis datasets Reanalysis datasets are incredibly useful datasets providing gridded atmospheric conditions at consistent spatial and temporal resolutions for the past 5-7 decades. Initially developed to constrain the initial conditions for weather forecasts, we used them in probabilistic tephra modeling to estimate the most likely wind conditions at a given volcano. We typically download 10-20 years of wind, and these datasets provide one wind profile per either 1, 6, 12 or 24 hours.

Across the 3 runs, P1 had accumulations of 0 \\(kg/m^2\\) for the first two simulations and 5 \\(kg/m^2\\) for the third one. P2 resulted in accumulations of 15, 12 and 2 \\(kg/m^2\\) over runs 1,2 and 3, respectively. P3 had accumulations of 7, 5 and 0 \\(kg/m^2\\) for runs 1,2 and 3, respectively. Let's now consider two tephra accumulation thresholds of 1 and 10 \\(kg/m^2\\) . We want to express how likely these accumulations are to occur over our set of runs. Let's take two examples: Across the 3 runs, an accumulation of 1 \\(kg/m^2\\) at P1 occurred in 1/3 cases: a future tephra accumulations at P1 therefore has a 33% probability to exceed a threshold of of 1 \\(kg/m^2\\) . At P2 , an accumulation of 10 \\(kg/m^2\\) occurred in 2/3 cases: a tephra accumulation of 10 \\(kg/m^2\\) therefore has a 66% probability of occurrence. By repeating this approach over all points of the map, it is now possible to represent the spatial distribution of hazard. What probabilities? Again, pay attention to what these probabilities express : In the case of lava flows , one single model run estimates a boolean yes/no inundation for each pixel, and the probabilistic approach quantifies a probability of flow inundation (\u2192 one single map). In the case of tephra deposits, one single model run estimates a continuous hazard intensity (i.e., mass of tephra per unit area). The probabilistic approach quantifies a probability of accumulation to exceed specific masses per unit area. Therefore, the output for probabilistic hazard assessment for tephra accumulation consists of multiple maps (\u2192 one map per accumulation threshold).

Let's look at the different methods available to display probabilistic hazard analyses. For tephra fallout, we have 4 quantities to represent that are: Latitude and longitude . Tephra accumulation . Probability of occurrence . However, it is difficult to represent more than 3 quantities on such a 2D canvas as a map, and we therefore need to fix one quantity , which provides us with 3 different approaches to express hazard.

On the left, probabilistic hazard maps quantify the probability to exceed a mass accumulation. Contours show equal probabilities . On the right, probabilistic isomass maps show the mass accumulation occurring for a given probability. Contours show equal accumulations . Therefore, both maps show the same information but emphasise different quantities.

To produce probabilistic hazard maps , we adopt the frequentist approach previously described and calculate the probability to exceed a given mass accumulation \u2192 e.g., this pixel has a 3/5 = 60% probability of exceeding a tephra accumulation of 10 \\(kg/m^2\\) . To produce probabilistic isomass maps , we estimate the inverse of an empirical cumulative density function (i.e., the survivor function) using all modelled accumulations \u2192 e.g., the accumulation associated with a 25% exceedence probability is 36 \\(kg/m^2\\) .

This plot shows hazard curves computed for three different locations (see the maps for reference): Tarumizu City Hall Kagoshima airport Tarumizu central station Curves show a continuous relationship between tephra accumulation and their respective probabilities of occurrences. The advantage of hazard curves is that they can represent more than a single eruption scenario , which helps comparison. For instance, these plots contain the modelling of the VEI 4 eruption scenario using wind profiles for i) all seasons combined (solid line), the summer (dashed line) and spring, fall and winter (dotted line). To read these plots, start by identifying one tephra accumulation for which you want to estimate the associated probability of occurrence. From the plot's x axis, go straight up until the intersection with the curve representing the scenario of interest.

Although tephra is not one of the main causes of casualties in the context of volcanic crisis (tephra are responsible for only 2% of all volcano-related deaths), it can cover wide areas and disrupt a broad range of socio-economic activities. Examples are health problems, collapse of roofs, death of vegetation, blockage of roads and disruption of airports and air traffic. Some hazardous tephra thresholds are shown in the table below. These ranges are wide due to the range of typologies of crops, vegetation, buildings that can be impacted, as well as external factors (e.g. time of the year for crops).

Probabilistic modeling will be performed using the model Tephra2 1 and the Matlab toolbox TephraProb 2 . In this exercise, you will use the user-friendly Matlab toolbox called TephraProb to: Analyse the eruptive record and perform some basic frequency analyses. Analyse the wind patterns in a region and put this in the perspective of the hazard assessment. Running the full workflow for probabilistic hazard assessment in the computer lab is complicated by technical issues (e.g., computation time, compilation of source libraries). Therefore, we have already ran the scenario for you. You will nevertheless: Learn how to interpret the sampling of ESP . Analyse the hazard outputs. TephraProb For more information about TephraProb , you can refer to the: Video tutorial . Updates on the code's website .

Left of the address bar at the top of the main Matlab window, click on the icon Browse for Folder and navigate to the location of TephraProb (i.e. the location of the file tephraProb.m ). In the Matlab command line, type TephraProb and press enter to start TephraProb . Get the eruption data Each one of you was assigned a different vent.

Place it in the RUNS folder located in your copy of TephraProb RUNS folder If the RUNS folder does not exist at the root of TephraProb , please create it. Hazard assessment This exercise is structured in 4 parts: Analysing the eruptive record of La Palma using the GVP database. Analysing wind patterns at la Palma using the EMCWF ERA-5 database. Defining an eruption scenario and associated ESP . Analysing the hazard output. Eruption history As already introduced, the GVP database compiles the eruptive history of Holocene volcanoes based on their VEI . Each volcano is identified by an id , which is 383010 for La Palma. Let's have a look at the eruptive history of La Palma based on the GVP database. On the main TephraProb window, click Input>GVP . Enter the id , click Access and wait a few seconds. This first plot is a histogram showing the frequency of occurrence of each VEI . This is not super informative for La Palma, so change the Plot type to Cumulative and click the Plot button. This new plot shows the cumulative number of eruption through time, colour-coded by the VEI . Reading between the lines... The GVP database is incredibly useful but, since based on the VEI , shares similar strengths and weaknesses previously discussed. Namely, the VEI works best for large, explosive eruptions, but not that well for eruption in the smaller spectrum of explosive styles such as those in La Palma. When thinking about the GVP data, bear in mind: The 2021 eruption is reported as Undefined VEI because no article reporting it has yet been published. However, we know it was a VEI 3 eruption. In the GVP , eruptions that have been identified as having an explosive component but for which no tephra volume are reported are assigned a default VEI of 2 2 . This is probably why most eruptions for la Palma are reported as VEI 2. Conversely, eruptions for which no explosive component was identified in the field are reported with an undefined VEI . This might indicate that no tephra was produced or, more likely, that it was eroded. Question 1: Eruptive history On the cumulative GVP plot, what does the slope of the plot (i.e., the ratio of y to x ) represent? How does it vary in time, and how do you explain it? What is the annual frequency of eruption for the recent history? VEI and plume height The VEI scale suggests very approximative indications of plume height for each VEI class. For instance, it suggests heights of 1-5 km for VEI 2 and 3-15 km for VEI 3 eruptions. However, the VEI scale does not include any information about intensity of the eruption (\u2192 duration over which the VEI volume was erupted). The volume associated with the 2021 VEI 3 eruption was erupted over the course of a few months , but plume heights were in the 1-5 km range rather than the 3-15 km range. Therefore, let's consider here the following plume heights: VEI 2 : 1-5 km. VEI 3 - low intensity : 1-5 km. VEI 3 - hight intensity : 3-15 km (\u2192 intense eruption lasting for hours). Wind data analysis In order to take into account the aleatoric variability of atmospheric conditions in the hazard assessment, a large population of wind profiles is required from which a different wind profile is randomly sampled at each model run. The atmospheric database used here is the EMCWF ERA-5 database. Downloading atmospheric data takes time - we have therefore already prepared the dataset for you. The dataset contains 5 years of wind for the period 2017-2021, providing 4 wind profiles per day at a resolution of 0.25 degrees above La Palma. Wind population For the purpose of the exercise, we are using 5 years of wind data, which facilitates transfer and speed up analyses. Keep in mind that we usually use larger populations for real applications (typically more than 10 years depending on the variability in a given region). Analysing wind patterns You can now display wind profiles. Keep your eyes opened for seasonal trends in both wind direction and speed. On the main TephraProb window, click Input>Wind>Analyze wind Select the wind.mat file located in WIND/CumbreVieja_1721/ A new pannel opens, on which you can explore wind profiles either using wind profiles or wind roses . Wind profiles Wind profiles show wind velocity and wind direction as a function of altitude. Wind profiles can be plotted either separately (e.g., one wind profile per year or per month) or averaged (e.g., mean \u00b1 standard deviation). Wind rose Wind roses show the probability (concentric circles) of the wind blowing in each direction [0 - 360 degrees]. Colours indicate wind velocity. Wind roses are plotted for a given elevation , so explore a few. Question 2: Wind conditions Visualize these wind patterns in the context of a hazard assessment. What is the main wind direction? How will that affect tephra dispersal? How does the mean wind direction vary with height? How is that affecting eruptions of different sizes? (\u2192 refer to the note about VEI and plume heights above). Do you notice any seasonality? If yes, identify during what months it happens. Eruption scenario Let's try and forget what we know about the 2021 eruption and put ourselves in this reasoning framework: We need to assess the hazard associated with tephra accumulation for a future eruption at La Palma. Looking at the GVP catalogue, we see that most eruptions are VEI 2 . Knowing i) the limitations of the GVP catalogue and ii) that we observed in the field deposits seemingly larger than VEI 2 eruptions, we decide to focus on a VEI 3 eruption. However, the deposits we observed don't look like short-lasting, subplinian VEI 3 eruptions. We suspect that these eruptions were less intense, and we therefore model an eruption lasting between 3 days to one week with plume heights varying between 1-5 km. We have no information regarding the grain-size distribution of the observed deposits, and therefore decide to use an analogue eruption to inform us. We chose the 2002 eruption of Etna volcano. Grain size distribution For clarity, we haven't touched yet on the concept of grain-size distribution or GSD . This is an important ESP for tephra dispersal as it controls how fine (or coarse ) the tephra generated at fragmentation level will be, and therefore will control how far particles will go . Grain size is expressed in \\(\\Phi\\) units, which is calculated as \\(-log_2(d)\\) , where \\(d\\) is the particle diameter in \\(mm\\) . In \\(\\Phi\\) units: A 1 mm-particle has \\(\\Phi=0\\) . Particles coarser than 1 mm have negative \\(\\Phi\\) values. Particles finer than 1 mm have positive \\(\\Phi\\) values. In Tephra2 the GSD of the model deposit is considered to be a Gaussian distribution centered on \\(Md_\\Phi\\) (i.e., mean) and varying by \\(\\sigma_\\Phi\\) (i.e., standard deviation). See what we just did? We just defined an eruption scenario ! The table below summarises the ESP for our low-intensity VEI 3 eruption.

A new window opens, from which you can select pre-defined accumulation threshold (you can select multiple using the Cmd (Mac) or the Ctrl (Windows) keyboard buttons). Click Ok - Google Earth should now open . Troubleshooting Google Earth If Google Earth is in French : Google Earth is in French by default. To change the language, go to Outils/Options/General/Parametres de langue and choose your language. If Google Earth does not open: From the main TephraProb window, select File > Preferences and make sure the Show Google Earth option is selected. Question 5: Probability maps Describe the geometry (i.e., extent, orientation) of selected probability maps. With your knowledge of hazardous thresholds of tephra accumulations previously discussed, what can you conclude with respect to the risk related to tephra fallouts? Probabilistic isomass maps Probabilistic isomass maps fix a probability threshold to represent a typical tephra accumulation given a probability of occurrence of the hazardous phenomenon. The choice of the probability threshold, which can be regarded as an acceptable level of hazard, is a critical aspect that is the resort of decision-makers. Scientists should therefore communicate results from probabilistic isomass maps with care. To plot probabilistic isomass maps: From the main TephraProb window, click Display > Isomass Maps . A new window opens, from which you can select pre-defined probability thresholds. Choose them all. Click Ok - Google Earth should now open . The figures below are DDS compiled by Jenkins et al (2015) 4 . Use them to answer these questions. Question 6: Probabilistic isomass maps Consider the possible consequences of tephra fallout on the road network. Using the 25% and 75% isomass maps, discuss: Where could the potential impact states occur? What consequences would that have on the mobility on the island? Discuss these briefly . Infrastructures Roofs Agriculture Hazard curves Using OpenStreetMap and Google Maps , select three points covering agricultural area and note their coordinates (in lat , lon ). Let's now look at hazard curves. For each vent, hazard curves for three points have been processed. To visualise them: From the main TephraProb window, choose Input > Points . From the new window, chose File > Load and select the GRID/LaPalma_ventX/LaPalma_ventX.points file. The points appear, click Plot to visualise them. Each point is summarised below.

Assume that: The functional impact of ash on the road network. Houses are domestic reinforced concrete. Vineyard fall into the ground crops category and Orchards in the tree crops . Food for thoughts Well done - you have successfully completed a scenario-based probabilistic hazard assessment for tephra accumulation ! Keep in mind that: The scenario-based part implies that this hazard is contitional to the occurrence of the eruption scenario. This contrasts with a fully probabilistic volcanic hazard assessment , where the spatio-temporal probability of occurrence of given volcanic phenomena also need to be accounted for. Having pretty maps is great... but knowing how to communicate the hazard output and the associated assumptions and uncertainties is often equally important . Keep that in mind for the rest of the exercises, both in the lab and in the field. Getting the hazard data As displayed in Matlab , you can save the maps displayed within TephraProb by simply typing saveAllMaps('png') , which will save all opened maps to TephraProb/MAPS . The raw output data for both probability and isomass maps are saved as ascii raster file with a UTM 28 N projection. Probability ( PROB ) and isomass ( IM ) data are located in: TephraProb/RUNS/ventX/1/PROB/all/RASTER/*.txt TephraProb/RUNS/ventX/1/IM/all/RASTER/*.txt These are useful for use in external softwares (e.g., QGIS ). Similarly, kml files are stored in the KML folder of your run. Hazard curves must be saved from within Matlab .

This is not super informative for La Palma, so change the Plot type to Cumulative and click the Plot button. This new plot shows the cumulative number of eruption through time, colour-coded by the VEI . Reading between the lines... The GVP database is incredibly useful but, since based on the VEI , shares similar strengths and weaknesses previously discussed. Namely, the VEI works best for large, explosive eruptions, but not that well for eruption in the smaller spectrum of explosive styles such as those in La Palma. When thinking about the GVP data, bear in mind: The 2021 eruption is reported as Undefined VEI because no article reporting it has yet been published. However, we know it was a VEI 3 eruption. In the GVP , eruptions that have been identified as having an explosive component but for which no tephra volume are reported are assigned a default VEI of 2 2 . This is probably why most eruptions for la Palma are reported as VEI 2. Conversely, eruptions for which no explosive component was identified in the field are reported with an undefined VEI . This might indicate that no tephra was produced or, more likely, that it was eroded. Question 1: Eruptive history On the cumulative GVP plot, what does the slope of the plot (i.e., the ratio of y to x ) represent? How does it vary in time, and how do you explain it? What is the annual frequency of eruption for the recent history? VEI and plume height The VEI scale suggests very approximative indications of plume height for each VEI class. For instance, it suggests heights of 1-5 km for VEI 2 and 3-15 km for VEI 3 eruptions. However, the VEI scale does not include any information about intensity of the eruption (\u2192 duration over which the VEI volume was erupted). The volume associated with the 2021 VEI 3 eruption was erupted over the course of a few months , but plume heights were in the 1-5 km range rather than the 3-15 km range. Therefore, let's consider here the following plume heights: VEI 2 : 1-5 km. VEI 3 - low intensity : 1-5 km. VEI 3 - hight intensity : 3-15 km (\u2192 intense eruption lasting for hours).","title":"Eruption history"},{"location":"Hazard_tephra_beyond/#wind-data-analysis","text":"In order to take into account the aleatoric variability of atmospheric conditions in the hazard assessment, a large population of wind profiles is required from which a different wind profile is randomly sampled at each model run.

The dataset contains 5 years of wind for the period 2017-2021, providing 4 wind profiles per day at a resolution of 0.25 degrees above La Palma. Wind population For the purpose of the exercise, we are using 5 years of wind data, which facilitates transfer and speed up analyses.

Wind rose Wind roses show the probability (concentric circles) of the wind blowing in each direction [0 - 360 degrees]. Colours indicate wind velocity. Wind roses are plotted for a given elevation , so explore a few. Question 2: Wind conditions Visualize these wind patterns in the context of a hazard assessment. What is the main wind direction? How will that affect tephra dispersal? How does the mean wind direction vary with height? How is that affecting eruptions of different sizes?

Looking at the GVP catalogue, we see that most eruptions are VEI 2 . Knowing i) the limitations of the GVP catalogue and ii) that we observed in the field deposits seemingly larger than VEI 2 eruptions, we decide to focus on a VEI 3 eruption. However, the deposits we observed don't look like short-lasting, subplinian VEI 3 eruptions. We suspect that these eruptions were less intense, and we therefore model an eruption lasting between 3 days to one week with plume heights varying between 1-5 km. We have no information regarding the grain-size distribution of the observed deposits, and therefore decide to use an analogue eruption to inform us. We chose the 2002 eruption of Etna volcano. Grain size distribution For clarity, we haven't touched yet on the concept of grain-size distribution or GSD . This is an important ESP for tephra dispersal as it controls how fine (or coarse ) the tephra generated at fragmentation level will be, and therefore will control how far particles will go . Grain size is expressed in \\(\\Phi\\) units, which is calculated as \\(-log_2(d)\\) , where \\(d\\) is the particle diameter in \\(mm\\) . In \\(\\Phi\\) units: A 1 mm-particle has \\(\\Phi=0\\) . Particles coarser than 1 mm have negative \\(\\Phi\\) values. Particles finer than 1 mm have positive \\(\\Phi\\) values. In Tephra2 the GSD of the model deposit is considered to be a Gaussian distribution centered on \\(Md_\\Phi\\) (i.e., mean) and varying by \\(\\sigma_\\Phi\\) (i.e., standard deviation).

This might indicate that no tephra was produced or, more likely, that it was eroded. Question 1: Eruptive history On the cumulative GVP plot, what does the slope of the plot (i.e., the ratio of y to x ) represent? How does it vary in time, and how do you explain it? What is the annual frequency of eruption for the recent history? VEI and plume height The VEI scale suggests very approximative indications of plume height for each VEI class. For instance, it suggests heights of 1-5 km for VEI 2 and 3-15 km for VEI 3 eruptions. However, the VEI scale does not include any information about intensity of the eruption (\u2192 duration over which the VEI volume was erupted). The volume associated with the 2021 VEI 3 eruption was erupted over the course of a few months , but plume heights were in the 1-5 km range rather than the 3-15 km range. Therefore, let's consider here the following plume heights: VEI 2 : 1-5 km. VEI 3 - low intensity : 1-5 km. VEI 3 - hight intensity : 3-15 km (\u2192 intense eruption lasting for hours). Wind data analysis In order to take into account the aleatoric variability of atmospheric conditions in the hazard assessment, a large population of wind profiles is required from which a different wind profile is randomly sampled at each model run. The atmospheric database used here is the EMCWF ERA-5 database. Downloading atmospheric data takes time - we have therefore already prepared the dataset for you. The dataset contains 5 years of wind for the period 2017-2021, providing 4 wind profiles per day at a resolution of 0.25 degrees above La Palma. Wind population For the purpose of the exercise, we are using 5 years of wind data, which facilitates transfer and speed up analyses. Keep in mind that we usually use larger populations for real applications (typically more than 10 years depending on the variability in a given region). Analysing wind patterns You can now display wind profiles. Keep your eyes opened for seasonal trends in both wind direction and speed. On the main TephraProb window, click Input>Wind>Analyze wind Select the wind.mat file located in WIND/CumbreVieja_1721/ A new pannel opens, on which you can explore wind profiles either using wind profiles or wind roses . Wind profiles Wind profiles show wind velocity and wind direction as a function of altitude. Wind profiles can be plotted either separately (e.g., one wind profile per year or per month) or averaged (e.g., mean \u00b1 standard deviation). Wind rose Wind roses show the probability (concentric circles) of the wind blowing in each direction [0 - 360 degrees]. Colours indicate wind velocity. Wind roses are plotted for a given elevation , so explore a few. Question 2: Wind conditions Visualize these wind patterns in the context of a hazard assessment. What is the main wind direction? How will that affect tephra dispersal? How does the mean wind direction vary with height? How is that affecting eruptions of different sizes? (\u2192 refer to the note about VEI and plume heights above). Do you notice any seasonality? If yes, identify during what months it happens. Eruption scenario Let's try and forget what we know about the 2021 eruption and put ourselves in this reasoning framework: We need to assess the hazard associated with tephra accumulation for a future eruption at La Palma. Looking at the GVP catalogue, we see that most eruptions are VEI 2 . Knowing i) the limitations of the GVP catalogue and ii) that we observed in the field deposits seemingly larger than VEI 2 eruptions, we decide to focus on a VEI 3 eruption. However, the deposits we observed don't look like short-lasting, subplinian VEI 3 eruptions. We suspect that these eruptions were less intense, and we therefore model an eruption lasting between 3 days to one week with plume heights varying between 1-5 km. We have no information regarding the grain-size distribution of the observed deposits, and therefore decide to use an analogue eruption to inform us. We chose the 2002 eruption of Etna volcano. Grain size distribution For clarity, we haven't touched yet on the concept of grain-size distribution or GSD . This is an important ESP for tephra dispersal as it controls how fine (or coarse ) the tephra generated at fragmentation level will be, and therefore will control how far particles will go . Grain size is expressed in \\(\\Phi\\) units, which is calculated as \\(-log_2(d)\\) , where \\(d\\) is the particle diameter in \\(mm\\) . In \\(\\Phi\\) units: A 1 mm-particle has \\(\\Phi=0\\) . Particles coarser than 1 mm have negative \\(\\Phi\\) values. Particles finer than 1 mm have positive \\(\\Phi\\) values. In Tephra2 the GSD of the model deposit is considered to be a Gaussian distribution centered on \\(Md_\\Phi\\) (i.e., mean) and varying by \\(\\sigma_\\Phi\\) (i.e., standard deviation). See what we just did? We just defined an eruption scenario ! The table below summarises the ESP for our low-intensity VEI 3 eruption.

For each ESP , discuss: From what distribution have each ESP been sampled from? What prior knowledge do these distribution reflect? Hazard output Question 4: Probability calculation The previous module has introduced how to compute exceedence probability for tephra accumulation. Based on the 10 simulations below for pixel \\(x,y\\) , what are the probabilities of this pixel to suffer tephra accumulations exceeding: 50 \\(kg/m^2\\) ? 100 \\(kg/m^2\\) ? 150 \\(kg/m^2\\) ?

The figure below shows the survivor function for the data in the table above. Estimate the approximative load associated with probability values of: 25% 75% Load runs One single vent was assigned to each of you. For the rest of the exercise, make sure you refer only this one . Let's now load your assigned scenario, where runName goes from vent1 to vent5 : On the main TephraProb window, click File>Open Select the .mat file located in RUNS/runName/1/ Probability maps Probability maps fix a critical value of tephra accumulation ( \\(kg/m^2\\) ) to allow the contouring of the spatial probability of exceeding this critical threshold. These maps are useful to see the dispersion of probabilities across an area, but only for one given tephra accumulation threshold at the time . Let's plot probability maps: Make sure the scenario for the vent that was attributed to you is loaded ( File > Load ). From the main TephraProb window, click Display > Probability Maps . A new window opens, from which you can select pre-defined accumulation threshold (you can select multiple using the Cmd (Mac) or the Ctrl (Windows) keyboard buttons).

To change the language, go to Outils/Options/General/Parametres de langue and choose your language. If Google Earth does not open: From the main TephraProb window, select File > Preferences and make sure the Show Google Earth option is selected. Question 5: Probability maps Describe the geometry (i.e., extent, orientation) of selected probability maps. With your knowledge of hazardous thresholds of tephra accumulations previously discussed, what can you conclude with respect to the risk related to tephra fallouts? Probabilistic isomass maps Probabilistic isomass maps fix a probability threshold to represent a typical tephra accumulation given a probability of occurrence of the hazardous phenomenon. The choice of the probability threshold, which can be regarded as an acceptable level of hazard, is a critical aspect that is the resort of decision-makers. Scientists should therefore communicate results from probabilistic isomass maps with care. To plot probabilistic isomass maps: From the main TephraProb window, click Display > Isomass Maps . A new window opens, from which you can select pre-defined probability thresholds. Choose them all. Click Ok - Google Earth should now open . The figures below are DDS compiled by Jenkins et al (2015) 4 . Use them to answer these questions. Question 6: Probabilistic isomass maps Consider the possible consequences of tephra fallout on the road network. Using the 25% and 75% isomass maps, discuss: Where could the potential impact states occur? What consequences would that have on the mobility on the island? Discuss these briefly . Infrastructures Roofs Agriculture Hazard curves Let's now look at hazard curves. For each vent, hazard curves for three points have been processed. To visualise them: From the main TephraProb window, choose Input > Points . From the new window, chose File > Load and select the GRID/LaPalma_ventX/LaPalma_ventX.points file. The points appear, click Plot to visualise them. Each point is summarised below.

Assume that: The functional impact of ash on the road network. Houses are domestic reinforced concrete. Vineyard fall into the ground crops category and Orchards in the tree crops . Food for thoughts Well done - you have successfully completed a scenario-based probabilistic hazard assessment for tephra accumulation ! Keep in mind that: The scenario-based part implies that this hazard is contitional to the occurrence of the eruption scenario. This contrasts with a fully probabilistic volcanic hazard assessment , where the spatio-temporal probability of occurrence of given volcanic phenomena also need to be accounted for. Having pretty maps is great... but knowing how to communicate the hazard output and the associated assumptions and uncertainties is often equally important . Keep that in mind for the rest of the exercises, both in the lab and in the field. Getting the hazard data As displayed in Matlab , you can save the maps displayed within TephraProb by simply typing saveAllMaps('png') , which will save all opened maps to TephraProb/MAPS . The raw output data for both probability and isomass maps are saved as ascii raster file with a UTM 28 N projection. Probability ( PROB ) and isomass ( IM ) data are located in: TephraProb/RUNS/ventX/1/PROB/all/RASTER/*.txt TephraProb/RUNS/ventX/1/IM/all/RASTER/*.txt These are useful for use in external softwares (e.g., QGIS ). Similarly, kml files are stored in the KML folder of your run. Hazard curves must be saved from within Matlab .

Each volcano is identified by an id , which is 383010 for La Palma. Let's have a look at the eruptive history of La Palma based on the GVP database. On the main TephraProb window, click Input>GVP . Enter the id , click Access and wait a few seconds. This first plot is a histogram showing the frequency of occurrence of each VEI . This is not super informative for La Palma, so change the Plot type to Cumulative and click the Plot button. This new plot shows the cumulative number of eruption through time, colour-coded by the VEI . Reading between the lines... The GVP database is incredibly useful but, since based on the VEI , shares similar strengths and weaknesses previously discussed. Namely, the VEI works best for large, explosive eruptions, but not that well for eruption in the smaller spectrum of explosive styles such as those in La Palma. When thinking about the GVP data, bear in mind: The 2021 eruption is reported as Undefined VEI because no article reporting it has yet been published. However, we know it was a VEI 3 eruption. In the GVP , eruptions that have been identified as having an explosive component but for which no tephra volume are reported are assigned a default VEI of 2 2 . This is probably why most eruptions for la Palma are reported as VEI 2. Conversely, eruptions for which no explosive component was identified in the field are reported with an undefined VEI . This might indicate that no tephra was produced or, more likely, that it was eroded. Question 1: Eruptive history On the cumulative GVP plot, what does the slope of the plot (i.e., the ratio of y to x ) represent? How does it vary in time, and how do you explain it? What is the annual frequency of eruption for the recent history? VEI and plume height The VEI scale suggests very approximative indications of plume height for each VEI class. For instance, it suggests heights of 1-5 km for VEI 2 and 3-15 km for VEI 3 eruptions. However, the VEI scale does not include any information about intensity of the eruption (\u2192 duration over which the VEI volume was erupted). The volume associated with the 2021 VEI 3 eruption was erupted over the course of a few months , but plume heights were in the 1-5 km range rather than the 3-15 km range. Therefore, let's consider here the following plume heights: VEI 2 : 1-5 km. VEI 3 - low intensity : 1-5 km. VEI 3 - hight intensity : 3-15 km (\u2192 intense eruption lasting for hours).","title":"Eruption history"},{"location":"Hazard_tephra_exercise/#wind-data-analysis","text":"In order to take into account the aleatoric variability of atmospheric conditions in the hazard assessment, a large population of wind profiles is required from which a different wind profile is randomly sampled at each model run.

Tephra deposits are widespread deposits generated by explosive volcanic eruption (see Figures 1-5 for examples). The objective of this module explore what is tephra, why are tephra deposits important and how they can impact populations and assets around volcanoes. Later in the module, we will learn how to model the transportation and deposition of tephra, and how to quantify their associated hazards. Objectives The objective of this lessons are to understand: What are tephra deposits. Why they are relevant and what can we learn from them. How they can impact communities. Tephra deposits In the field, tephra deposits generally appear as unconsolidated pyroclastic material that are able to blanket the existing topography. Deposits follow the direction of the dominant wind during the eruptions. As a consequence, a short lasting eruption occurring in a single dominant wind pattern might elongate in a unique direction, whereas long(er)-lasting eruptions can be affected by variable wind profiles and present a less conspicuous unique dispersal direction. With distance from the vent: The thickness of deposits decrease exponentially. Their grain-size distributions become finer . Below are some examples of tephra deposits.

The layering reflects the variability of both eruptive and atmospheric conditions throughout the course of the eruption. In this section, the coarsest material is lapilli and the finest is ash (Picture: S. Biass). Figure 2: Proximal outcrop of the Golden Pumice deposit of K\u012blauea volcano in Hawaii. This deposit is associated with episodes of intense fountaining (Picture: S. Biass). Figure 3: Deposit associated with the 1888-1890 eruption of La Fossa volcano, Italy. This section represents years of unsustained, pulsatory Vulcanian activity (Picture: S. Biass). Figure 4: Deposit associated with the AD 946\u2013947 Plinian Millenium eruption of Changbaishan volcano (China/North Korea). The airborne deposit lies on a lahar deposit (Picture: S. Jenkins). Figure 5: Complex stratigraphy associated with the Oranui eruption of Taup\u014d volcano, New Zealand. This is the largest eruption of the past 70,000 years, with a VEI of 8 (Picture: S. Biass). Size classification of tephra Tephra fragments - or pyroclasts - can be classified in three categories according to their size: Ash \u2013 particles smaller than 2 mm in diameter. Lapilli \u2013 between 2 and 64 mm in diameter. Bombs or blocks \u2013 larger than 64 mm in diameter. Why are tephra deposits important? Tephra deposits are a direct reflection of the eruptive conditions occurring in the plume. By studying , mapping and characterizing these deposits, we can reconstruct the dynamics of eruption and estimate important eruption source parameters ( ESP ). Following the general idea that \"the past is the key to the future\" , this ability is critical to reconstruct the eruptive history of volcanic systems from their stratigraphic record and, in turn, constrain their potential future activity. Field-based methods For recent eruption, direct observation methods can infer ESP in near-real time (e.g., satellite imagery for plume height, infrasound for mass eruption rate ( MER )). However, field-based approaches remain the main approach to extract knowledge from old tephra deposits. Figure 6: Tephra deposits (right) are a direct consequence of the plume dynamics. On the left, the plume associated with the 2015 eruption of Calbuco, Chile (Picture: AFP). On the right, a tephra deposit associated with a Plinian eruption of Cotopaxi volcano, Ecuador (Picture: S. Biass). Volcanic explosivity index The Volcanic explosivity index 2 - or VEI - is a \"measure\" of eruption size based on the volume of tephra produced during an eruption. Despites its limitations (i.e., it is a stepwise measure and largely aggregates small but frequent eruptive styles into a non-explosive category), it remains the most commonly used metrics. Bear in mind that its primary purpose was communication , and it does a great job at it. For measures that better account for the dynamics of eruption, the combined use of magnitude and intensity 3 might be more appropriate. More information can be found here . Field mapping toolbox These sketches provide an overview of the general process followed to characterize tephra deposits. Outcrop Deposit ESP Workflow As we start the field characterisation of a deposit, we first look for outcrops where a given deposit is complete. At the outcrop level, we will start directly measuring a number of different physical quantities including: The deposit thickness . The diameter of the l argest clast(s) observed at this location. The grain-size distribution. The componentry (e.g., ratio of juvenile vs lithics components, presence of free crystals or oxydised particles). Note that following Steno's laws of superposition , the base of the outcrop is older than the top. Therefore, any variability of these parameters in the vertical section indicates a change in time (either of eruption dynamics or wind conditions). As a sufficient number of outcrops is discovered and mapped, we can start plotting them on a map and contour the spatial extent of these properties. Two maps greatly interest us: Isopach maps contour the deposit thickness , which can be used to compute the deposit volume and associated VEI / magnitude. Isopleth maps contour the largest clast that is observed at a given outcrop, which can be used to estimate the plume height and associated MER and intensity. This process is the foundation of the field characterization of tephra deposits and help quantifying ESP 4 . This workflow summarises the entire field-based characterisation of ESPs from tephra deposits. flowchart LR A3 --> A32[VEI]:::clasf A4 --> A42[Magnitude]:::clasf A1[Thickness]:::field ==> A2[Isopach] ==> A3[Volume]:::esp ==> A4[Mass]:::esp ==> F[Eruption duration]:::esp B1[Largest clast]:::field ==> B2[Isopleth] ==> B3[Plume height]:::esp ==> B4[Mass eruption rate]:::esp ==> F A2 --> A22[\"Thinning\" rate]:::clasf B2 --> B22[\"Fining\" rate]:::clasf C[Bulk deposit density]:::field -.-> A4 D[Wind speed] -.-> B4 B4 --> B42[Intensity]:::clasf classDef field fill:#cbdc3850, stroke:#cbdc38; classDef esp fill:#1f78b450, stroke:#1f78b4; classDef clasf fill:#984ea350, stroke:#984ea3; flowchart LR subgraph Legend [\" \"] l1[Field/outcrop measurement]:::field l2[Eruption source parameter]:::esp l3[Classification parameter]:::clasf end classDef field fill:#cbdc3850, stroke:#cbdc38; classDef esp fill:#1f78b450, stroke:#1f78b4; classDef clasf fill:#984ea350, stroke:#984ea3; What impacts can be caused by tephra? Tephra hazard We will focus here on airborne tephra , considering the fraction that is entrained in the convective plume and advected by the wind and ignoring the hazard associated with pyroclastic density currents (PDC). The impact of tephra can be classified in two broad categories: The atmospheric dispersal can impact the air traffic as demonstrated by the 2010 and 2011 eruptions of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull (Iceland) and Cord\u00f3n Caulle (Chile), respectively. In this case, the main hazard impact metrics ( HIM ) is the atmospheric concentration of fine ash in the atmosphere (usually expressed in \\(mg/m^3\\) ). Since modeling the atmospheric dispersal requires 3D models with high computing costs, we won't consider this aspect here. The ground sedimentation impacts populations and assets at the surface of the Earth, and the main hazard impact metrics are a combination of the mass load of tephra (usually expressed in \\(kg/m^2\\) ) and the grain-size distribution of the deposit. This will be the focus of this exercise. Deposit load vs thickness Measuring the mass load in the field is time consuming, and we are therefore often limited to measuring the outcrop's thickness. For simplicity throughout this exercise, we will consider that mass load and thickness can be interchanged using a bulk density of 1000 \\(kg/m^3\\) . So, for instance: 1 \\(mm\\) = 1 \\(kg/m^2\\) . 1 \\(cm\\) = 10 \\(kg/m^2\\) . 10 \\(cm\\) = 100 \\(kg/m^2\\) . 1 \\(m\\) = 1000 \\(kg/m^2\\) . A spatially-dependent hazard intensity Tephra deposits can extend 10's, 100's to 1000's of km away from the source. With distance from the vent, their thickness decrease exponentially and they gradually get finer. The widespread nature of tephra deposits and the spatial evolution of their associated hazard metrics make the associated impacts and risk difficult to predict 5 . Impacts can be broadly characterised into 3 zones as a function of the distance from the vent 6 : Zone 1 : Destructive and immediately life-threatening. Zone 2 : Damaging and/or disruptive. Zone 3 : Disruptive and/or a nuisance. Figure 7: Schematic of some ash fall impacts with distance from a volcano. This assumes a large explosive eruption with significant ash fall thicknesses in the proximal zone and is intended to be illustrative rather than prescriptive. Adapted from Jenkins et al. (2015). A relative distance The distance acting as a limit between these zones is relative and varies with the eruption style. The deposits of large (e.g. Plinian) eruptions will extend farther away than those of smaller (e.g. Vulcanian) eruptions, and the extent of zones 1-3 will vary accordingly. Vulnerability and risk Since the 70's/80's, a change of paradigm the concept of vulnerability as a cornerstone of volcanic risk 7 . For the purpose of this exercise, let's consider that the risk \\(R\\) can be defined as a function of at least 3 components that are: \\(H\\) - hazard - expressing the spatial (and temporal) distribution of the intensity of a hazardous phenomenon. \\(E\\) - elements at risk - expressing the presence of exposed populations, assets, goods, natural features, ecosystem services etc. to the hazardous phenomenon. \\(V\\) - vulnerability - expressing how the exposed element will be negatively impacted as a function of the hazard intensity. The most fundamental definition of risk is defined as \\(R = f(H,E,V)\\) . Although this exercise focuses on hazard , a meaningful discussion of hazard outputs usually borrows some concept of vulnerability to illustrate results. Ideally, all facets of vulnerability would be described by continuous and quantitative mathematical functions (also able to characterize the associated uncertainties). Amongst these, we distinguish between fragility and vulnerability functions (see below). These curves are typically primarily sourced in empirical post-event impact assessments , starting from in situ observations of impacts following disasters, and complemented with additional investigations (e.g., analytical, experimental, numerical). flowchart LR subgraph pre-EIA B[\"Fragility/vulnerability curves\"] end subgraph post-EIA A0[\"Thresholds\"] --> A[\"Damage/Disruption states\"] end pre-EIA --> post-EIA post-EIA --> C[\"Experimental + numerical\"] --> pre-EIA Practically, the relatively low frequency of volcanic eruptions compared to other natural hazards limits the availability of opportunistic post-event impact assessments: this impedes the development of accurate, quantitative fragility/vulnerability functions. As a result, most current vulnerability models in volcanology rely on empirical post-event impact assessments , which are discrete, semi-quantitative scales based on hazard thresholds corresponding to the onset of specific observed impacts 8 : Type Description Threshold Hazard intensity thresholds for onset of a given impact. Weak buildings are typically assume to start collapsing at tephra thicknesses of 100-300 \\(kg/m^2\\) , although this is highly dependent on the building morphology, quality and on the properties of the deposit. Damage/disruption states ( DDS ) Stepwise categorisation of impact as a function of hazard intensity. On example is to assume that pastoral agriculture can suffer production losses <50%, >50%, and total for accumulations of 25, 60 and 100 mm of tephra 8 . Fragility function Mathematical function expressing the probability of a level of impact being equalled or exceeded for a given hazard intensity 8 . See Figure 9 for an example of fragility functions defined for composite European roofs 9 . Vulnerability function Same as the fragility function, but expressing a relative loss or economic cost to hazard intensity. Damage disruption state Fragility function Figure 8: Example of damage/disruption states for ground crops (modified after Jenkins et al. 2015). Figure 9: Example of fragility functions describing the probability of collapse for weak (WE), medium weak (MW), medium strong (MS) and strong (ST) roofs as a function of the tephra load. Other variables considered in risk estimates Throughout the course, we are likely to discuss other actors of risk. Amongst them are: Resilience , which is the opposite of vulnerability and describes the condition that will reduce the negative consequences of a natural hazard. Cost , which is required to express the risk as a monetary value. Food for thoughts The 2015 edition of the Global assessment report ( GAR ) on disaster risk reduction report by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction represents the first inclusion of volcanic risk within the UN risk framework. This testifies of the growing awareness of the potential global impact of future large eruptions on modern societies. Similarly, re-insurance companies are beginning to include volcanic risk in their portfolios and developing new dedicated products through, for instance, parametric risk transfer solutions 10 and CAT bonds . Despites these new efforts, the complexity of the hazard associated with tephra fallout and the full range of potential impacts is often under-appreciated. This shortcoming is rooted in two main causes. On the one hand, eruptions are complex multi-hazard events. Each eruptions style is associated with specific hazards: for instance, the hazards associated with Strombolian eruptions are different than those associated with phreatomagmatic or Plinian events. These hazards evolve in space and time, creating complex vulnerability patterns . On the other hand, volcanic eruptions are less frequent than other natural hazards. As a consequence, and our empirical dataset of observations available to predict future impacts based on past lessons is more limited, which impedes the development of operational impact models. The Global Volcanic Hazards and Risk book, published in 2015 in the context of the GAR report, contains a chapter entitled Volcanic ash fall hazard and risk by Jenkins et al. 6 . This chapter is freely accessible online and offers a review of the impacts and proposes tentative damage/disruption states for key vulnerability aspects. Specifically: Tables 3.2 \u2192 3.5 illustrate the range of impacts as a function of the zones defined above. Tables 3.6 \u2192 3.8 propose damage/disruption states based on a comprehensive review of the literature. This chapter provides the currently most useful and pragmatic compilation of available DDS related to the tephra hazard. We encourage you to get familiar with these values for the hazard and impact exercises in the lab and in the field!

So, for instance: 1 \\(mm\\) = 1 \\(kg/m^2\\) . 1 \\(cm\\) = 10 \\(kg/m^2\\) . 10 \\(cm\\) = 100 \\(kg/m^2\\) . 1 \\(m\\) = 1000 \\(kg/m^2\\) .","title":"What impacts can be caused by tephra?"},{"location":"Hazard_tephra_intro/#a-spatially-dependent-hazard-intensity","text":"Tephra deposits can extend 10's, 100's to 1000's of km away from the source. With distance from the vent, their thickness decrease exponentially and they gradually get finer. The widespread nature of tephra deposits and the spatial evolution of their associated hazard metrics make the associated impacts and risk difficult to predict 5 . Impacts can be broadly characterised into 3 zones as a function of the distance from the vent 6 : Zone 1 : Destructive and immediately life-threatening. Zone 2 : Damaging and/or disruptive. Zone 3 : Disruptive and/or a nuisance. Figure 7: Schematic of some ash fall impacts with distance from a volcano. This assumes a large explosive eruption with significant ash fall thicknesses in the proximal zone and is intended to be illustrative rather than prescriptive. Adapted from Jenkins et al. (2015). A relative distance The distance acting as a limit between these zones is relative and varies with the eruption style. The deposits of large (e.g. Plinian) eruptions will extend farther away than those of smaller (e.g. Vulcanian) eruptions, and the extent of zones 1-3 will vary accordingly.","title":"A spatially-dependent hazard intensity"},{"location":"Hazard_tephra_intro/#vulnerability-and-risk","text":"Since the 70's/80's, a change of paradigm the concept of vulnerability as a cornerstone of volcanic risk 7 . For the purpose of this exercise, let's consider that the risk \\(R\\) can be defined as a function of at least 3 components that are: \\(H\\) - hazard - expressing the spatial (and temporal) distribution of the intensity of a hazardous phenomenon. \\(E\\) - elements at risk - expressing the presence of exposed populations, assets, goods, natural features, ecosystem services etc. to the hazardous phenomenon. \\(V\\) - vulnerability - expressing how the exposed element will be negatively impacted as a function of the hazard intensity. The most fundamental definition of risk is defined as \\(R = f(H,E,V)\\) . Although this exercise focuses on hazard , a meaningful discussion of hazard outputs usually borrows some concept of vulnerability to illustrate results. Ideally, all facets of vulnerability would be described by continuous and quantitative mathematical functions (also able to characterize the associated uncertainties). Amongst these, we distinguish between fragility and vulnerability functions (see below). These curves are typically primarily sourced in empirical post-event impact assessments , starting from in situ observations of impacts following disasters, and complemented with additional investigations (e.g., analytical, experimental, numerical). flowchart LR subgraph pre-EIA B[\"Fragility/vulnerability curves\"] end subgraph post-EIA A0[\"Thresholds\"] --> A[\"Damage/Disruption states\"] end pre-EIA --> post-EIA post-EIA --> C[\"Experimental + numerical\"] --> pre-EIA Practically, the relatively low frequency of volcanic eruptions compared to other natural hazards limits the availability of opportunistic post-event impact assessments: this impedes the development of accurate, quantitative fragility/vulnerability functions. As a result, most current vulnerability models in volcanology rely on empirical post-event impact assessments , which are discrete, semi-quantitative scales based on hazard thresholds corresponding to the onset of specific observed impacts 8 : Type Description Threshold Hazard intensity thresholds for onset of a given impact. Weak buildings are typically assume to start collapsing at tephra thicknesses of 100-300 \\(kg/m^2\\) , although this is highly dependent on the building morphology, quality and on the properties of the deposit. Damage/disruption states ( DDS ) Stepwise categorisation of impact as a function of hazard intensity. On example is to assume that pastoral agriculture can suffer production losses <50%, >50%, and total for accumulations of 25, 60 and 100 mm of tephra 8 . Fragility function Mathematical function expressing the probability of a level of impact being equalled or exceeded for a given hazard intensity 8 . See Figure 9 for an example of fragility functions defined for composite European roofs 9 . Vulnerability function Same as the fragility function, but expressing a relative loss or economic cost to hazard intensity. Damage disruption state Fragility function Figure 8: Example of damage/disruption states for ground crops (modified after Jenkins et al. 2015). Figure 9: Example of fragility functions describing the probability of collapse for weak (WE), medium weak (MW), medium strong (MS) and strong (ST) roofs as a function of the tephra load. Other variables considered in risk estimates Throughout the course, we are likely to discuss other actors of risk. Amongst them are: Resilience , which is the opposite of vulnerability and describes the condition that will reduce the negative consequences of a natural hazard. Cost , which is required to express the risk as a monetary value.","title":"Vulnerability and risk"},{"location":"Hazard_tephra_intro/#food-for-thoughts","text":"The 2015 edition of the Global assessment report ( GAR ) on disaster risk reduction report by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction represents the first inclusion of volcanic risk within the UN risk framework. This testifies of the growing awareness of the potential global impact of future large eruptions on modern societies. Similarly, re-insurance companies are beginning to include volcanic risk in their portfolios and developing new dedicated products through, for instance, parametric risk transfer solutions 10 and CAT bonds . Despites these new efforts, the complexity of the hazard associated with tephra fallout and the full range of potential impacts is often under-appreciated. This shortcoming is rooted in two main causes. On the one hand, eruptions are complex multi-hazard events. Each eruptions style is associated with specific hazards: for instance, the hazards associated with Strombolian eruptions are different than those associated with phreatomagmatic or Plinian events. These hazards evolve in space and time, creating complex vulnerability patterns . On the other hand, volcanic eruptions are less frequent than other natural hazards. As a consequence, and our empirical dataset of observations available to predict future impacts based on past lessons is more limited, which impedes the development of operational impact models. The Global Volcanic Hazards and Risk book, published in 2015 in the context of the GAR report, contains a chapter entitled Volcanic ash fall hazard and risk by Jenkins et al. 6 . This chapter is freely accessible online and offers a review of the impacts and proposes tentative damage/disruption states for key vulnerability aspects. Specifically: Tables 3.2 \u2192 3.5 illustrate the range of impacts as a function of the zones defined above. Tables 3.6 \u2192 3.8 propose damage/disruption states based on a comprehensive review of the literature.

In contrast, most models for tephra dispersal and deposition require a physics-based approach to assess associated hazards. This module introduces the modelling strategy that will be adopted throughout the following exercises, which relies on Tephra2 and TephraProb . Objectives Understand the large-scale physical processes controlling tephra dispersal modeling. Review various modeling strategies, their purposes, benefits and limitations. Introduce the concept of eruption source parameters . Modeling tephra dispersal Models are approximation of reality. In the case of natural hazards, a useful model must be able to estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of hazard intensity metrics as a function of initial contitions : flowchart LR A[Initial conditions] --> B[[MODEL]] --> C[Hazard intensity metrics] For instance, a simple flood model might attempt to estimate the inundated area (\u2192 HIM ) as a function of rainfall and the watershed properties (\u2192initial conditions). Models can be classified in two main categories: Physical models rely on a simplified formulation of physical laws. Mathematical models are data-driven and namely include statistical or machine learning-powered models. Q-LavHA falls in this category. This part of the module focuses on the use of a physical model. Model parametrisation A physical model is a parametrisation of natural processes, which means that the physics behind a phenomenon is described by a set of equations that we could theoretically solve with the right input parameters . For instance, accurately describing tephra transport and deposition requires to account for the following aspects: The generation of volcanic particles. The ejection of volcanic pyroclasts in the atmosphere (\u2192 the vertical column ). The dispersal of this material by the wind in the atmosphere (\u2192 the \"mushroom\" horizontal plume ). The sedimentation of particles onto the ground (\u2192 the tephra deposit ). There is no unique way of solving this problem. Depending on the assumptions behind the physical processes and the purpose of the model, the governing equations can be posed in a more or less complex way. This slideshow summarises the various steps that tephra transport and deposition models have to solve: Exsolution Fragmentation Convection Wind advection Tephra sedimentation Volatiles (\u2192 gases) dissolved in the magma starts to escape. As a result, the liquid magma starts rising in the conduit. The liquid accelerates upwards, the rate of deformation becomes critical and the liquid starts behaving like a solid. The magma becomes brittle and fragments: it is now a cloud of solid (\u2192 pyroclasts) particles surrounded by gas. The material reaches the atmosphere with sufficient momentum to entrain surrounding air. The plume becomes lighter than the atmosphere and rises from buoyancy forces. After entraining sufficient air, the plume reaches the same density as the atmosphere (\u2192 level of neutral buoyancy). The umbrella cloud develops and elongates in the direction of the wind. Particles are carried horizontally in the umbrella cloud. As it evolves away from the source, it becomes less \"strong\" and is not able to transport particles. Large particles leave the umbrella cloud first and fall close to the vent, while finer particles are carried farther away, creating the tephra deposit . Strong plumes These cartoons assume a strong plume with a typical mushroom-shaped morphology. However, keep in mind that other types of transitional or weak plumes exist. If the vertical rate of ascent of the plume is not sufficiently high, the plume can collapse and create pyrocalstic density currents . Modeling choices Some models attempt solving all physical processes taking place in time and space. These models are complex and (theoretically) have a higher accuracy. However, their use is often impeded by: The large number of input parameters required to solve all the physics. The high computational time required to run them. Alternatively, other models adopt assumptions that allows them to simplify some physical processes. Although their (again, theoretical) accuracy is lower, these models: Require less input parameters, which facilitates their use. Are faster to run as they do not need to solve as many equations. What model is better for hazard assessment? Is a complex numerical model always better than a simpler model (e.g., empirical or probabilistic)? Well, not necessarily, it all depends on context . When a high accuracy is required, complex numerical models are generally better. However, they usually require a large number of input parameters and an important computing power. Therefore, they are not suited for probabilistic analyses as their computational time is too large, and they are therefore mostly used for deterministic modeling. Conversely, simpler models might not capture all the subtleties of the underlying processes, but are easier to use and require less computation cost. Therefore, they can be used for probabilistic modeling and are often used for long-term hazard assessments. The Tephra2 model In order to assess the hazard associated with tephra accumulation, we will here use the Tephra2 model 1 . Tephra2 uses an analytical solution to the advection-diffusion equation . In other words: Tephra2 simplifies the atmospheric transport of particles, thanks to which the tephra accumulation can be computed rapidly. Numerous of input parameters related to atmospheric transport are parametrised into a few parameters. Computation time is fast. These specificities make Tephra2 highly suited for probabilistic hazard assessment purposes. Tephra2 requires three different inputs (Figure 1): A computation grid \u2192 the spatial resolution of Tephra2 outputs is set by the grid resolution. A coarse grid will result in longer computation time than a fine one. Wind conditions during the eruption \u2192 specifically wind direction ( \\(^{\\circ}\\) ) and speed ( \\(m/s\\) ). Eruption source parameters \u2192 initial eruption conditions to the model. Figure 1: Input parameters required by Tephra2 Other models The design of Tephra2 prevents it to compute atmospheric concentration , for which 3D models are usually required. Such models include Ash3D , which can be used as an online tool after registration, or Fall3D , available here . Eruption source parameters Let's introduce an important concept that we will use throughout the exercise: Eruption source parameter or ESP : Eruption source parameters ESP are the initial conditions required by a given model to describe specific physical processes. ESP are therefore synonyms of initial conditions . Why a different name then? Let's look at the main ESP required by Tephra2 : ESP Description mass Total tephra mass erupted during the eruption, in \\(kg\\) . height Plume height, in \\(km\\) . TGSD Total grain-size distribution ( TGSD ) \u2192 controls the content in coarse vs fine particles, in \\(\\phi\\) units \u2192 \\(=-log_2(diam.\\ [mm])\\) . MER Indirectly used in Tephra2 , the mass eruption rate ( MER ; \\(kg/m^2\\) ) is estimated from height and wind speed . Do you notice anything? \u2192 All these EPS are quantities that can be directly measured in the field! Therefore, we, as Physical volcanologists/Geologists/Earth Scientists, can directly translate geological information into model inputs in the perspective of our knowledge of the underlying processes. Thanks to that, we prevent over-fitting our model (i.e., tuning initial conditions to fit a desired output) or using a black-box approach. Food for thoughts Many different models for tephra dispersal and deposition exist, some of which can be found here , or in the report of the 2021 Ash and Aviation Workshop report . It is again important to chose the appropriate model for a given context . For instance, Tephra2 is suited for probabilistic hazard analyses, but being time-independent, it cannot capture the spatio-temporal evolution of the ash cloud. It is therefore more suited for preparedness rather than crisis management . Conversely, Fall3D 2 is a 3D, time-dependent model that is able to describe the evolution of the ash cloud in 4D. Its computational costs limits its probabilistic applications, but it is suited to monitor the evolution of a crisis in near-real time. As a result, the same remarks as those made for lava flow models hold for tephra hazard assessment: It is important to understand the benefit and limitations of each model in order to choose the most appropriate one. Similarly, various models will require different types of ESP , some of which can be directly estimated from field studies, others that require additional laboratory analyses or plain guessing. Here, we use the Tephra2 model as its main ESPs can be estimated in the field. In the next section, we will look at how to turn ESP into eruption scenarios . Summary This section provided an introduction to the modeling of tephra dispersal and deposition. We reviewed: The main physical volcanology aspects involved in the problem. Various modeling approaches available to solve it. Introduced Tephra2 and its critical ESP . In the next section, we will look at the philosophy behind using Tephra2 for probabilistic hazard modelling.

3: Eruption probability"},{"location":"Hazard_tephra_temporal/","text":"Adding a temporal component The hazard assessment previously produced represents a scenario-based approach, meaning that the spatial distribution of hazard values is conditional to the occurrence of the eruption scenario . In this sense, this type of data does not contain any temporal information on the probability of occurrence of a given eruption scenario. Relying here on the assumption that the future eruptive behaviour of a given volcano will follow its past trend , we will here introduce a component of eruption probability to the scenario-based approach using a simple Poisson approach. Objectives The aim of this exercise is to illustrate how a temporal component can be added to a scenario-based hazard assessment. We will consider VEI -based eruption scenarios and use the GVP database to assess eruptive history. The objectives of this module are to: Understand caveats when projecting past history to future eruption scenarios (i.e., historical v. geological biases). Compute probabilities of occurrences of eruptions of specific VEI using a Poisson approach. Eruptive history Assumption Here, we assume that the past is the key to the future . In other words, we will only attempt to predict a similar behaviour compared to what has already happened . We have already briefly touched upon the estimation of eruption frequency for La Palma . However, this has illustrated the limitations of the GVP database for low-explosivity eruptions, and the record for La Palma is dominated by VEI 2 eruptions. Let's start our journey through eruptive records by taking a look at the global eruption record . Global eruption record Look at the figures below. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 1 shows global rates of eruptions recorded by the GVP for the past 6 centuries 1 . Before moving to Figure 2, spend some time thinking about this plot and what you can observe. Figure 1: Global eruption record from the GVP catalogue (Simkin et al., 2010). Solution This plot shows an apparent increase in active volcanoes through time . Is that really true? Nah. Figure 2 puts this data in a different perspective. Figure 2 shows this global rate in the perspective of population growth and - tadaa! - both increases are correlated. So the more people, the more eruption reports. In the 15th century, great expeditions and the development of the printed press increased the probability of both new eruptions to not remain unnoticed, but also their record to persist through time. Figure 2: Global eruption record from the GVP catalogue (Simkin et al., 2010). Figure 3 zooms on the last 200 years and further puts the global eruptive record into perspective of two aspects: Great wars and economic crises result in a drop in the number of reported eruptions. Large eruptions result in an increase in reports through renewed interests. In addition, one last thing to observe is that although the global rate of eruption increases, the record of relatively large (i.e., \u2265 VEI 4) eruptions through time remains constant. Figure 3: Global eruption record from the GVP catalogue (Simkin et al., 2010). Geological vs historical record Various methods have been developed to quantify eruptions frequencies and probabilities 2 3 . Although not all yielding the same results, one aspect remains clear: Small eruptions are more frequent than large eruptions. When interpreting eruption catalogues, it is necessary to interpret trends in the perspective of both geological and historical biases. A historical bias arises from the fact that small eruptions are frequent, but result in thin deposits that are likely to suffer erosion . In unpopulated places (or at the time when specific places were unpopulated), they are also likely to go unnoticed. The historical bias can result in two main consequences: 1. The recent eruptive record is dominated by small, frequent eruptions that are missing from the older record. 2. The perception of future the activity at a given volcano is dominated by the recent history. A geological bias is the consequence of the fact that larger eruptions are less frequent but are more likely to be preserved in the stratigraphy . As a result, the oldest part of an eruption catalogue might be (apparently) dominated by large eruptions and be depleted from the smaller spectrum of activity. Conversely, the recent history might not contain any occurrence of large eruptions. The following exercise digs into the eruptive history of Cotopaxi volcano (Ecuador) Exercise We have already looked at one VEI 4 Plinian eruption of Cotopaxi volcano (Ecuador). Let's look at its eruptive history as documented by the GVP catalogue. Figure 4 plots the cumulative number of eruptions (y-axis) through time considering eruptions of all VEI . Figure 4: Eruptive history of Cotopaxi volcano. Question 1: Eruptive history Look at Figure 4: How does the eruptive record changes in time, both in term of frequency and VEI ? Validating initial assumptions Let's put back the eruptive record of Cotopaxi volcano in the context of the first assumption that future activity will reflect the trends observed in the past . As a matter of fact, the behaviour at Cotopaxi volcano changed from dominantly rhyolitic to dominantly andesitic about 4000 years ago 4 . The GVP plot shows how most VEI 5 eruptions occurred before that shift. Therefore, we will only attempt predicting frequencies of future eruptions based on the recent andesitic activity , and we must discard the 6 VEI 5 eruptions older than 4000 years from our analysis. Bear in mind that we don't argue here that predicting what has not yet happened is impossible - it is a very different approach that has to account for very low probabilities and high uncertainties. Record completeness Following the same approach as before, let's retrieve the eruptive history for Cotoaxi from TephraProb : On the main TephraProb window, click Input>GVP . Enter the id of 352050 , click Access and wait a few seconds. This first plot shows the frequency of occurrence of each VEI . Change the Plot type to Cumulative and click the Plot button. This new plot shows the cumulative number of eruption through time, colour-coded by the VEI . Note that you can select and plot individual VEI classes. Let's reflect back on the two different biases: Historical bias \u2192 the recent part of the eruptive catalogue is biased towards smaller eruptions \u2192 it records most small eruptions, but large eruptions might be to rare to have occurred in this recent history. Geological bias \u2192 the older part of the eruptive catalogue is biased towards larger eruptions \u2192 it records most large eruptions, but small eruptions might have been lost to erosion. In order to correct these biases, it is necessary to assess which part of the eruption record is complete for a given VEI . We have previously seen that the slope of the segments visible on these cumulative plots represents a frequency of eruption . Under the assumption that the future will reflect the past, we must assess where the eruption frequency is constant. Let's do this for VEI 3 and VEI 4. Using TephraProb 's GVP tool, plot the frequency of VEI 3 and VEI 4 eruptions for Cotopaxi volcano. Starting from the present, navigate back in time and identify a shift in eruption frequency . This indicates when the eruptive record for a given VEI ceases to be complete. Question 2: Record completeness What year marks the onset of record completeness for eruptions of VEI 3 and 4 at Cotopaxi volcano? What are the eruption frequencies (in number of eruptions per year) for both VEI ? Eruption probability It is sometime possible to assume that volcanic eruptions are stochastic processes that can be described by a Poisson distribution. This assumption requires eruptions to be independent (i.e., no dependency between the repose interval and magnitude) and may occur only one at a time. In addition, the probability of an event occurring in the next small time increment does not depend on the time that has already elapsed since the last event occurred 5 6 . Here, we are interested in estimating the probability \\(P\\) of a repose time \\(T\\) to be smaller than or equal to an hypothetical time period \\(t\\) . The simplest case of a Poisson process results in an exponential distribution, and we can estimate the probability of an eruption to occur in a given time interval as: \\[\\begin{equation} P(Erupt. \\leqslant \\Delta t) = 1-e^{-\\lambda\\Delta t} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(\\lambda\\) is the mean eruption rate (nb of eruption per year) and \\(\\Delta t\\) is the forecasting time period, starting from present day. Question 3: Eruption probability What is the probability of: A VEI 3 eruption to occur in the next 10 years? 100 years? A VEI 4 eruption to occur in the next 10 years? 100 years? Independence The assumption of independence between events must be tested and demonstrated before using this method. Independence may occur for large-scale eruptions, but generally fails for more frequent, pulsatory types of activity (e.g., Vulcanian or Strombolian activity) 7 . Food for thoughts This module provides a first-order introduction to the temporal analysis of eruption frequencies. Note that this is an active topic of research, and that this lesson's objective is to raise awareness on the caveats associated with global eruption records. Note that eruption forecasts are usually split between long-term and short-term depending on the timescale. Here, this approach relates to the long-term forecast of eruption probability. We refer you to the existing literature on the topic for more information 8 9 10 11 . Summary This module has introduced the concept of eruptive history and global records. We have reviewed: How to interpret trends from eruption catalogues. How to account for historical and geological biases. How to apply a simple statistical model to estimate the probability of occurrence of a VEI -based scenario. References Simkin, T., Siebert, L., Simkin, T., Kimberly, P., 2010. Volcanoes of the World.

This online textbook is under work - this is just currently a stub! Pyroclastic deposits result from the sedimentation of pyroclasts through the atmosphere plume during an explosive eruption. Pyroclast - from Greek pyros (fire) and clastic (broken) represent fragmentary material ejected during a volcanic eruption. The objective of this module explore the journey of a pyroclast from the magma chamber to its sedimentation on the ground and, through this, review the range of processes that generate tephra deposits. In another module, we will then learn what we can learn from these deposits. Objectives The objective of this lessons are to understand: How tephra is generated, transported and deposited on the ground The nature of the physical processes taking place along this journey How tephra fall deposits are formed General concepts Pyroclast and tephra Pyroclast and tephra are more or less synonyms, but tephra is more frequently used in the scientific literature. Why are tephra deposits important? Tephra deposits are a direct reflection of the eruptive conditions occurring in the plume (Figure 1). By studying , mapping and characterizing these deposits, we can reconstruct the dynamics of eruption and estimate important eruption source parameters ( ESP ). Following the general idea that \"the past is the key to the future\" , this ability is critical to reconstruct the eruptive history of volcanic systems from their stratigraphic record and, in turn, constrain their potential future activity. Figure 1: Tephra deposits (right) are a direct consequence of the plume dynamics. On the left, the plume associated with the 2015 eruption of Calbuco, Chile (Picture: AFP). On the right, a tephra deposit associated with a Plinian eruption of Cotopaxi volcano, Ecuador (Picture: S. Biass). Below are some examples of tephra deposits.

What is tephra? Pyroclast and tephra more or less describe the same thing. Tephra was first defined by Sigur\u00f0ur \u00de\u00f3rarinsson 1 following the 1947 eruption of Hekla volcano in Iceland as: Definition The fragmental material produced by a volcanic eruption regardless of composition, fragment size, or emplacement mechanism. Tephra particles are typically described in terms of their componentry and size . Componentry Tephra fragments - or pyroclasts - can be classified in two main families depending on their origins : Juvenile clasts, which consider all clasts originating from fresh magma (e.g., pumice, ash) Lithic clasts, which represent dense clasts generally sourcing in country rocks. Grain size Individual tephra particles are also subdivided in term of their size : bombs / blocks lapilli coarse ash fine ash Diameter > 64 mm (64 mm\u20132 mm) ( >2 mm\u201363\u03bcm) <63\u03bcm Residence time \u2248 sec \u2248 min \u2248 hours to few days several days Travel distance proximal <10km medial <50 km distal <100 km very distal <1000 km Following a sedimentology approach, particles size is generally described in \\(\\Phi\\) units: \\[ \\Phi = log2(d [mm]) \\] Ash Lapilli Bomb Ash from the 2021 Cumbre Vieja eruption covering a sport field (Picture: S. Biass). Golden Pumice deposit from K\u012blauea, grading from coarse ash (bottom) to coarse lapilli (top). Notice Pelee's hair at the top (Picture: S. Biass). Large pyroclast from K\u012blauea (Picture: S. Biass). Grain size distribution Rather than the size of individual particles, what interests us most is the size distribution within an outcrop. Grain size distributions summarise the percentage of weight represented by the particles in each \\(\\Phi\\) bin. We mostly describe two parameters 2 3 4 : Median or \\(Md \\Phi\\) : The 50th percentile ( \\(\\Phi 50\\) ) of the distribution \u2192 Small (even negative) \\(Md \\Phi\\) values describe coarse deposits \u2192 Large \\(Md \\Phi\\) values describe fine deposits Sorting or \\(\\sigma \\Phi\\) : The graphical standard deviation ( \\((\\Phi 84 - \\Phi 16)/2\\) ) \u2192 Small \\(\\sigma \\Phi\\) values describe well-sorted deposits \u2192 Large \\(\\sigma \\Phi\\) values describe poorly-sorted deposits Example of variably-sorted deposits. Which is the finest GSD ? Solution \u2192 The left distribution has a \\(Md \\Phi\\) of -1 (i.e., 2 mm) and is therefore coarser than the right distribution ( \\(Md \\Phi\\) of 1 , or 0.5 mm). Which is the better-sorted GSD ? Solution \u2192 The left distribution has a \\(\\sigma \\Phi\\) of 1 and is therefore well-sorted . The right distribution ( \\(\\sigma \\Phi\\) of 1 ) is poorly-sorted . Note that both distributions have the same \\(Md \\Phi\\) . How are tephra deposits emplaced? Look at the following two pictures and formulate hypotheses about emplacement dynamics : Mayon 1982 Sarychev 2009 1984 eruption of Mayon volcano, Philippines (Picture: C. Newhall). 2009 eruption of Sarychev volcano, Russia ( Source ). Hint Is emplacement horizontal or vertical ? Solution (?) Well, maybe a bit of both... We can consider two main mechanisms of emplacement: If the plume is buoyant , it will rise and become wind-advected, carrying tephra that will then sediment vertically , producing fall deposits . If, for any reason, the plume is not (or not anymore) buoyant (\u2192 bulk density exceeds that of the ambient atmosphere), pyroclastic density currents (or PDC) will spread laterally , producing flow deposits. PDC are complex mixtures of hot gases and particles that can be generated in several ways giving rise to several facies, the end-members of which being surges and flows . Fall and flows Types of PDC Schematic representation of fall (left) and flow (right) emplacement mechanisms (Source: Carey and Bursik 2015 5 ). In the left case, the plume is sufficiently buoyant to extend upwards. In the right case, this buoyant state is not initially reached, and a lateral momentum develops to produce directed flows. Note that in some cases, PDC can re-entrain air and become buoyant after some runoff (bottom right), giving rise to co-PDC plumes. PDC can be generated from a wide range of eruptions varying many scales, from small events (e.g., dome collapse) to large caldera-forming eruptions, which can produce welded deposits (i.e.; ignimbrites) (Source: Dufek et al. 2015 6 ). Lahars We are starting to make a distinction between vertical (\u2192 fall) and lateral (\u2192 flow) emplacement mechanisms. There is however another flow emplacement mechanism: Lahar Block-and-ash flow Small volume pyroclastic density current deposit composed of mostly dense to moderately vesicular juvenile blocks in medium to coarse ash matrix. Mostly generated during collapse of lava domes. References Thorarinsson, S., 1954. The eruption of Hekla, 1947-48, 3, The tephra-fall from Hekla, March 29th, 1947.

By studying , mapping and characterizing these deposits, we can reconstruct the dynamics of eruption and estimate important eruption source parameters ( ESP ). Following the general idea that \"the past is the key to the future\" , this ability is critical to reconstruct the eruptive history of volcanic systems from their stratigraphic record and, in turn, constrain their potential future activity. Figure 1: Tephra deposits (right) are a direct consequence of the plume dynamics. On the left, the plume associated with the 2015 eruption of Calbuco, Chile (Picture: AFP).

Newhall). 2009 eruption of Sarychev volcano, Russia ( Source ). Hint Is emplacement horizontal or vertical ? Solution (?) Well, maybe a bit of both... We can consider two main mechanisms of emplacement: If the plume is buoyant , it will rise and become wind-advected, carrying tephra that will then sediment vertically , producing fall deposits . If, for any reason, the plume is not (or not anymore) buoyant (\u2192 bulk density exceeds that of the ambient atmosphere), pyroclastic density currents (or PDC) will spread laterally , producing flow deposits. PDC are complex mixtures of hot gases and particles that can be generated in several ways giving rise to several facies, the end-members of which being surges and flows . Fall and flows Types of PDC Schematic representation of fall (left) and flow (right) emplacement mechanisms (Source: Carey and Bursik 2015 5 ). In the left case, the plume is sufficiently buoyant to extend upwards. In the right case, this buoyant state is not initially reached, and a lateral momentum develops to produce directed flows. Note that in some cases, PDC can re-entrain air and become buoyant after some runoff (bottom right), giving rise to co-PDC plumes. PDC can be generated from a wide range of eruptions varying many scales, from small events (e.g., dome collapse) to large caldera-forming eruptions, which can produce welded deposits (i.e.; ignimbrites) (Source: Dufek et al. 2015 6 ). Lahars We are starting to make a distinction between vertical (\u2192 fall) and lateral (\u2192 flow) emplacement mechanisms.

Raster data Raster data are stored as a grid of values - or pixels. There is no raster data on OSM , but two common raster datasets are satellite imagery or digital elevation models (or DEM). The main difference with vector datasets is that if you zoom sufficiently, pixels will start to appear. The zoom level at which this effect occurs depends on the raster's resolution , i.e., the size of a given pixel in the x and y directions. More information is available on the QGIS website.

Starting from field observations, the class will review how parent magma rises to the surface and identify the processes that control the behaviour of the associated phenomena (i.e., effusive vs explosive, fall vs flow etc.). Once identified, these processes will be investigated using controlled experiments in the lab and numerical modelling, and will be use to explore how and why i) natural phenomena becomes hazards and ii) how hazards become a risk to communities. The class is split into two modules in the fall and spring semesters. Fall The fall part of the class consists in Modelling Volcanic Processes . Using case studies and practical exercises, we explore how theoretical, numerical and experimental modelling can be used to investigate a variety of eruptive processes. The first module introduces concepts of physical volcanology rooted in field observations and reviews how field-based studies can help characterize and classify eruptions. The second and third modules introduce components of lab experiments and numerical modeling to investigate the shortcomings identified during module 1. Spring Main concepts of volcanic risk reduction are introduced. Using the knowledge gained during the fall semester, this module provides an introduction to the development of eruption scenarios used in stochastic modelling to produce probabilistic hazard assessments. This hazard assessment is then used in combination with key component of risk (e.g., vulnerability, resilience) to illustrate an integrated approach to volcanic risk reduction. La Palma (Spain) is used as a case study to discuss various aspects of volcanic hazard, impact and risk assessment. Objectives At the end of this course, students will be able to: characterize the dynamics of eruptions describe the physics of main volcanic flows understand the basics of numerical and experimental modelling of eruptive processes define the main steps of hazard assessments understand volcanic hazard maps combine the volcanic hazard, exposure and vulnerability for the assessment of risk identify key risk reduction strategies Lecturers Prof. Costanza Bonadonna, University of Geneva Dr S\u00e9bastien Biass, University of Geneva Dr Luc\u00eda Dominguez, University of Geneva Dr Allan Fries, University of Geneva Dr Corine Frischknecht, University of Geneva Prof Chris Gregg, University of Geneva Dr Jonathan Lemus, University of Geneva Evaluation mode The evaluation of the Fall and the Spring sessions will be combined as follows: Fall (50% of the final grade): exercises during lectures + reports of various activities Spring (50% of the final grade): presentations during field trip + report of the field trip + written exam in June","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"modelling_intro/#modelling-volcanic-processes","text":"The Physical volcanology and volcanic risk class aims to provide students with an overview of processes that turn volcanic surface phenomena into potential threats to surrounding communities.
